    Okay this is a very old time horror film. that means there is no blood and gore like today's horror flicks. Yes, there is death and destruction but done in a very understated manner. Una O'Conner is her usual very irritating self, mainly through her voice but that face doesn't help. Elsa Lancaster ends up as the bride but you never see her get killed by the weirdo. All she seems able to do is hiss at poor ole Frankie when she is reanimated. Boris Karloff is the monster and does a superb job as the actually misunderstood and ignorant monster. It is obvious in some scenes that he is just looking for understanding and sustenance. It is only when his needs are not met that he turns violent (not that I would give a being that looked liked that and couldn't talk an even chance). Young Frankenstein mirrors the blind monk so well and the poor monk is a victim of circumstance rather than a real victim. Don't get me wrong, in real life it needs to die. When the "Bride" rejects the monster and he just goes into a rage and they die it is what can be called poetic justice.

    Along with Tod Browning's 'Dracula' released the same year, the critical and commercial success of James Whale's 'Frankenstein' (1931) was responsible for the horror boom of the Thirties which gave us so many lasting classics like 'The Mummy' (1932) and 'The Black Cat' (1934) as well as Whale's own 'The Old Dark House' (1932) and the astonishing 'The Invisible Man' (1933). Yet, despite this success, Whale's artistic sensibilities meant that he was hesitant to make a sequel and was only lured into the director's chair when granted complete creative control. So, with Colin Clive and Boris Karloff who both reprising their respective roles as Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster, the resulting movie is a quite startling mixture of the kind of hysterical Gothic derangement and commentary on the human condition that characterised the original but which pushes further in playing with religious iconography as well as presenting an overt campness due (in no small part) to the scene-stealing performance of Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius. Like its illustrious predecessor, the movie explores the injustice enacted on the monster after having been given life by a God-playing mad scientist. As before, Karloff puts in a tremendous performance; however, where he articulated the Monster's loneliness and existential uncertainty through movement in the first movie due to the Monster's muteness, in 'Bride of Frankenstein' the Monster has acquired a basic speech capacity which even permits him to form a nascent friendship with a blind old man in one of the movie's many touching scenes. However, the friendship is short-lived and the Monster decides the only way to alleviate his loneliness is for his creator to create a mate, a bride, for him. Fortunately (or not) Dr. Frankenstein has been lured back to his studies by the flamboyant and sexually ambiguous Dr. Pretorius and the Monster's bride (as much a master-stroke of character design and make-up as the Monster himself) is duly brought to life in an animation scene easily the equal of that in 'Frankenstein'. However, a happy ending is not to be. Along with the magnificent performances, the film reprises the German expressionist influenced aesthetic in the sets and cinematography, which effortlessly recreate the sombre and macabre atmosphere which characterised the original. However, a major point of difference is that where the original film had no music, 'Bride of Frankenstein' completes its masterful display of what a horror film should be with a fitting and affecting score. As a result of all this, the film manages to do the impossible: that is, surpass the iconic power of the original and be "better" than a movie which, in itself, is near perfect. Naturally, 'Frankenstein' will get most of the praise on a pop-culture level as it was remarkable in its originality and the freshness of its depth as well as introducing Boris Karloff to the world. However, those who have dug a little deeper recognize that 'Bride of Frankenstein' is easily the equal to the original and stands as one of the best from the Golden Age of horror movies.

    The Bride of Frankenstein is an interesting sequel to say the least. It starts off by breaking the forth wall essentially and having an actress (Elsa Lanchester) play the author of the Frankenstein novel which leads to her saying she has more of a story to tell. We then get a few scenes from the original Frankenstein film which sums up some aspects of the film and then we are led right into the events immediately after. The Monster has lived as well as Henry Frankenstein. Does it feel a bit cheap? Yeah, I guess so but I've always given the horror genre the benefit of the doubt with sequels. And it doesn't matter because this film works really well for the most part. It is filled with fun, campy, over the top performances that keep the film highly entertaining. In general, the film seems to be self-aware and is somewhat a self-parody of the previous Universal horror flicks. Most of the film is really The Monster running into other people and having strange, awkward, and comical encounters with them. From The Monster eventually learning to talk to accidentally killing people in rage, this film remains extremely fun. Why is the film called The Bride of Frankenstein then? Honestly, I can't entirely figure it out myself. The Bride doesn't come until the tail end of the film which was a bit of an issue for me. I would have loved to see some fun, silly, self-aware scenes with The Monster and his Bride but sadly, we don't really get that. Regardless, the film is still a really fun time and might just be better than it's sequel which has only been done a handful of times and really almost never is done in the horror genre.

    BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) is one of the most misogynistic movies of all time! First of all, what kind of a movie is it in which the title character doesn't show up until there is less than five minutes to go? Yet the pale echo of the 1931 classic, in this case, "She's alive, she's alive!" does not occur until one hour, nine and one half minutes into a sequel that lasts just 74 minutes, 42.17 seconds! When the she-monster finally does make her appearance, she comes off as some dumb blonde bimbo, dismissing her designated mate with one glance with prejudicial looksism which denies that handsomeness is only skin deep. Evidentally, she has her cap set for the already-married Dr. Henry Frankenstein, who is obviously the intellectual inferior to the character played so loquaciously by Boris Karloff. But Karloff's monster comes off as a Ted Bundy type, setting a time bomb in motion with these stultifying words to his new bride: "You stay......we belong dead." Since when is murder-suicide romantic?

    There's a lot more comedy in this sequel to "Frankenstein" thanks to the madness of the wacky mad scientist played by Ernest Thesiger here. Somehow the monster escapes from the burning windmill laboratory, scaring the daylights out of the shrill Una O'Connor here. Nowhere in sight at the finale of "Frankenstein", O'Connor (wearing a head piece that looks like it came off of Dr. Frankenstein's wedding cake) dominates much of the film (as does Thesiger), and for once, a change of mood makes the follow-up even better than the original. For "The Bride of Frankenstein" is delightfully campy, utilizing many elements that Mel Brooks couldn't resist overplaying when he wrote his own comic version of the tale "Young Frankenstein" 40 years later. It all starts off with an enjoyable prologue where Elsa Lanchaster, as the real Mary Shelley, tells her pals "Wait, there's more!". The return of the monster brings out the wacky Dr. Pretorious, his collection of tiny creatures (a plot devise stolen for "The Devil Doll" the following year), and the monster's meeting with the blind man. Having seen "Young Frankenstein" more times than this, I couldn't help but quote lines from that ("Wait! I was going to make espresso!") during that sequence, and when Elsa Lanchaster comes back for the final moments as the bride, it not only brought back memories of Madeline Kahn in the Mel Brooks classic but her repeat of the character on "Saturday Night Live" singing "I Feel Pretty". John Carradine, who would go on to horror movie fame in his prime, has a brief appearance here as the hunter who discovers the monster along with the blind man, and "Sherlock Holmes" housekeeper Mary Gordon has a brief walk-on as one of the monster's earlier victims whose demise is almost comical in retrospect. As for Karloff's bringing speech into the monster's life, it is fine for one entry, especially comical for many of the scenes. Artistically, the film is breathtaking to look at, also returning Colin Clive as the doctor, with Valarie Hobson taking over the role of Elizabeth, previously played by Mae Clarke. She gives the character more strength here, standing up to her husband for what she believes his works to be those of Satan.

    On a dark and stormy night, original "Frankenstein" (1918) author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (here impersonated by Elsa Lanchester) discusses her astonishing morality tale with elegant poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. There is a part of her story where the monster appears to have expired, but he manages to survive for more eventful-filled chapters. The movie "Frankenstein" (1931) handled the death and resurrection differently, but will also continue, promises Ms. Shelley. And so, Universal and Carl Laemmle Jr. present her "Bride of Frankenstein"... Lightning strikes twice. This visually stunning motion picture is rightfully regarded as one of the best sequels ever created. They adapted the work exceptionally well - and, most importantly, hired James Whale to return as director. He makes William Hurlbut's screenplay a tapestry of horror weaved with humor. This results in subtext and shadows that continues to breathe new life into an old gem... There is great work from photographer John J. Mescall and art director Charles D. Hall. Franz Waxman's musical score is classic and soundman Gilbert Kurland received an "Oscar" nomination. As their bride, Ms. Lanchester is frightfully ravishing. If there were "Best Supporting Actor" awards in 1935, spectacularly demented mad scientist Ernest Thesiger (as Septimus Pretorius) gives everything you need for some consideration. There are so many levels from which you can enjoy watching, you're guaranteed to enjoy the "Bride of Frankenstein" on one of them. ********** Bride of Frankenstein (4/22/35) James Whale ~ Boris Karloff, Ernest Thesiger, Colin Clive, Elsa Lanchester

    Story Line: When I was starting to watch the film I was thinking "eh this frank overrated thing" I was so so wrong. This film is actually beautiful in it's own way. The story line was amazing 8/10 Cast/Acting Not a problem with any cast or acting I thought they were all good. Scares 2/10 I actually fount this more of a family film then a horror. I even got sad at some points of the film. Location 7/10 The village that everyone lived in was beautiful and vintage as well as the castle looking really Gothic. Best Bit - Frankenstein's monster learning to speak with his "friend" aw that was so cute. Worst bit - No one giving frank's monster a chance. It annoyed me. He only wanted a friend.

    Wow, Frankenstein's not nearly as scary as some of the nightmare architecture. Universal's art department went all out in coming up with castle interiors that look like they came from heck the soaring vaults, the corkscrew staircasesall bathed in semi-darkness like the movie itself. In fact, the whole production's a trip through a visual nightmare. And get a load of that wooden platform rising into the violent heavens like a barge into stormy seas. A great effect. Frankenstein, himself, is more like a backward child than a monster. He'd like to do right but has never been taught how. So he stumbles around looking for a "friend", but lacks the necessary social graces, to say the least. Then too, it doesn't help that his so-called bride (Lanchester), who's not exactly a pin-up herself, takes to him like a vegetarian does to a slab of meat. So, the monster is more like somebody you feel sorry for rather than a scary demon, that is, when he's not tossing people off cliffs or into pits. There's a detectable undercurrent of dark humor throughout, courtesy a crotchety O'Connor and an arch Thesiger. I can see why Universal gave director Whale total charge of the production. He manages a a stylish coherence to both the visual and spoken narrative that indicates a master is in charge. And was it he or maybe Lanchester who came up with those birdlike head jerks that define the monster's so- called bride. In many years of movie viewing, I've seen nothing quite like these weird spasms. No doubt about itthe film's a delicious bite out of the horror sandwich and really deserving of cult status.

    I guess I'm in trouble here. I'm not a fan of this film. It has its moments; for example, the scenes with the monster and the hermit are quite touching. But many parts of the film are simply too "campy". I'm not a fan of mixing genres unless it is clear which genre the film is supposed to be. For example, "Scared Stiff" with Martin & Lewis is clearly comedy. The Abbott & Costello films where they meet horror characters are clearly comedy. But it seems that this film can't decide if it is a horror drama or a horror comedy. The only performance that stands out in my mind is the hermit -- O.P. Heggie. Even Elsa Lanchester's performance is more campy than a serious acting performance. The place for this film to be stored would be in a freak show out in the Arizona desert along old route 66.

    It's easy to see why this sequel to "Frankenstein," in which the monster learns to talk and suffers an unrequited love, has been so often parodied. The story is weird without being especially creepy, the acting outrageously hammy, and the special effects thoroughly dated in a way that's amusing. In order to coerce Victor Frankenstein into building him a bride, the monster crashes into the bedroom of Frankenstein's own fianc&eacute;e and kidnaps her. I forget the comic strip in which the monster, instead of throwing her over his shoulder and running, begins to do her hair, combing and spraying it. But the original story is most thoroughly skewered in Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein," in which all the iconic moments are reduced to slapstick, with the exception of Ernest Thesiger's mad scientist who wears a yarmulke and reduces a horny king and his haughty queen to the size of tin toys. Thesiger turns in the best performance. There are times when he seems to realize he's in what would soon be treated as a source of comedy. Colin Clive, as Frankenstein, doesn't know it so he's all the more effective, shouting classic lines like, "It's alive! Oh, it's ALIVE!" Lionel Atwood is wooden -- all over. Elsa Lanchester has a chance to hiss and twitch and show off her spectacular make up as the bride who, lamentably, finds the monster as ugly as he believes himself to be. It remains a classic though.

There are so many levels from which you can enjoy watching, you're guaranteed to enjoy the "Bride of Frankenstein" on one of them. ********** Bride of Frankenstein (4/22/35) James Whale ~ Boris Karloff, Ernest Thesiger, Colin Clive, Elsa Lanchester

    Story Line: When I was starting to watch the film I was thinking "eh this frank overrated thing" I was so so wrong. This film is actually beautiful in it's own way. The story line was amazing 8/10 Cast/Acting Not a problem with any cast or acting I thought they were all good. Scares 2/10 I actually fount this more of a family film then a horror. I even got sad at some points of the film. Location 7/10 The village that everyone lived in was beautiful and vintage as well as the castle looking really Gothic. Best Bit - Frankenstein's monster learning to speak with his "friend" aw that was so cute. Worst bit - No one giving frank's monster a chance. It annoyed me. He only wanted a friend.

    Wow, Frankenstein's not nearly as scary as some of the nightmare architecture. Universal's art department went all out in coming up with castle interiors that look like they came from heck the soaring vaults, the corkscrew staircasesall bathed in semi-darkness like the movie itself. In fact, the whole production's a trip through a visual nightmare. And get a load of that wooden platform rising into the violent heavens like a barge into stormy seas. A great effect. Frankenstein, himself, is more like a backward child than a monster. He'd like to do right but has never been taught how. So he stumbles around looking for a "friend", but lacks the necessary social graces, to say the least. Then too, it doesn't help that his so-called bride (Lanchester), who's not exactly a pin-up herself, takes to him like a vegetarian does to a slab of meat. So, the monster is more like somebody you feel sorry for rather than a scary demon, that is, when he's not tossing people off cliffs or into pits. There's a detectable undercurrent of dark humor throughout, courtesy a crotchety O'Connor and an arch Thesiger. I can see why Universal gave director Whale total charge of the production. He manages a a stylish coherence to both the visual and spoken narrative that indicates a master is in charge. And was it he or maybe Lanchester who came up with those birdlike head jerks that define the monster's so- called bride. In many years of movie viewing, I've seen nothing quite like these weird spasms. No doubt about itthe film's a delicious bite out of the horror sandwich and really deserving of cult status.

    I guess I'm in trouble here. I'm not a fan of this film. It has its moments; for example, the scenes with the monster and the hermit are quite touching. But many parts of the film are simply too "campy". I'm not a fan of mixing genres unless it is clear which genre the film is supposed to be. For example, "Scared Stiff" with Martin & Lewis is clearly comedy. The Abbott & Costello films where they meet horror characters are clearly comedy. But it seems that this film can't decide if it is a horror drama or a horror comedy. The only performance that stands out in my mind is the hermit -- O.P. Heggie. Even Elsa Lanchester's performance is more campy than a serious acting performance. The place for this film to be stored would be in a freak show out in the Arizona desert along old route 66.

    It's easy to see why this sequel to "Frankenstein," in which the monster learns to talk and suffers an unrequited love, has been so often parodied. The story is weird without being especially creepy, the acting outrageously hammy, and the special effects thoroughly dated in a way that's amusing. In order to coerce Victor Frankenstein into building him a bride, the monster crashes into the bedroom of Frankenstein's own fianc&eacute;e and kidnaps her. I forget the comic strip in which the monster, instead of throwing her over his shoulder and running, begins to do her hair, combing and spraying it. But the original story is most thoroughly skewered in Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein," in which all the iconic moments are reduced to slapstick, with the exception of Ernest Thesiger's mad scientist who wears a yarmulke and reduces a horny king and his haughty queen to the size of tin toys. Thesiger turns in the best performance. There are times when he seems to realize he's in what would soon be treated as a source of comedy. Colin Clive, as Frankenstein, doesn't know it so he's all the more effective, shouting classic lines like, "It's alive! Oh, it's ALIVE!" Lionel Atwood is wooden -- all over. Elsa Lanchester has a chance to hiss and twitch and show off her spectacular make up as the bride who, lamentably, finds the monster as ugly as he believes himself to be. It remains a classic though.

    Okay this is a very old time horror film. that means there is no blood and gore like today's horror flicks. Yes, there is death and destruction but done in a very understated manner. Una O'Conner is her usual very irritating self, mainly through her voice but that face doesn't help. Elsa Lancaster ends up as the bride but you never see her get killed by the weirdo. All she seems able to do is hiss at poor ole Frankie when she is reanimated. Boris Karloff is the monster and does a superb job as the actually misunderstood and ignorant monster. It is obvious in some scenes that he is just looking for understanding and sustenance. It is only when his needs are not met that he turns violent (not that I would give a being that looked liked that and couldn't talk an even chance). Young Frankenstein mirrors the blind monk so well and the poor monk is a victim of circumstance rather than a real victim. Don't get me wrong, in real life it needs to die. When the "Bride" rejects the monster and he just goes into a rage and they die it is what can be called poetic justice.

    Along with Tod Browning's 'Dracula' released the same year, the critical and commercial success of James Whale's 'Frankenstein' (1931) was responsible for the horror boom of the Thirties which gave us so many lasting classics like 'The Mummy' (1932) and 'The Black Cat' (1934) as well as Whale's own 'The Old Dark House' (1932) and the astonishing 'The Invisible Man' (1933). Yet, despite this success, Whale's artistic sensibilities meant that he was hesitant to make a sequel and was only lured into the director's chair when granted complete creative control. So, with Colin Clive and Boris Karloff who both reprising their respective roles as Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster, the resulting movie is a quite startling mixture of the kind of hysterical Gothic derangement and commentary on the human condition that characterised the original but which pushes further in playing with religious iconography as well as presenting an overt campness due (in no small part) to the scene-stealing performance of Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius. Like its illustrious predecessor, the movie explores the injustice enacted on the monster after having been given life by a God-playing mad scientist. As before, Karloff puts in a tremendous performance; however, where he articulated the Monster's loneliness and existential uncertainty through movement in the first movie due to the Monster's muteness, in 'Bride of Frankenstein' the Monster has acquired a basic speech capacity which even permits him to form a nascent friendship with a blind old man in one of the movie's many touching scenes. However, the friendship is short-lived and the Monster decides the only way to alleviate his loneliness is for his creator to create a mate, a bride, for him. Fortunately (or not) Dr. Frankenstein has been lured back to his studies by the flamboyant and sexually ambiguous Dr. Pretorius and the Monster's bride (as much a master-stroke of character design and make-up as the Monster himself) is duly brought to life in an animation scene easily the equal of that in 'Frankenstein'. However, a happy ending is not to be. Along with the magnificent performances, the film reprises the German expressionist influenced aesthetic in the sets and cinematography, which effortlessly recreate the sombre and macabre atmosphere which characterised the original. However, a major point of difference is that where the original film had no music, 'Bride of Frankenstein' completes its masterful display of what a horror film should be with a fitting and affecting score. As a result of all this, the film manages to do the impossible: that is, surpass the iconic power of the original and be "better" than a movie which, in itself, is near perfect. Naturally, 'Frankenstein' will get most of the praise on a pop-culture level as it was remarkable in its originality and the freshness of its depth as well as introducing Boris Karloff to the world. However, those who have dug a little deeper recognize that 'Bride of Frankenstein' is easily the equal to the original and stands as one of the best from the Golden Age of horror movies.

    The Bride of Frankenstein is an interesting sequel to say the least. It starts off by breaking the forth wall essentially and having an actress (Elsa Lanchester) play the author of the Frankenstein novel which leads to her saying she has more of a story to tell. We then get a few scenes from the original Frankenstein film which sums up some aspects of the film and then we are led right into the events immediately after. The Monster has lived as well as Henry Frankenstein. Does it feel a bit cheap? Yeah, I guess so but I've always given the horror genre the benefit of the doubt with sequels. And it doesn't matter because this film works really well for the most part. It is filled with fun, campy, over the top performances that keep the film highly entertaining. In general, the film seems to be self-aware and is somewhat a self-parody of the previous Universal horror flicks. Most of the film is really The Monster running into other people and having strange, awkward, and comical encounters with them. From The Monster eventually learning to talk to accidentally killing people in rage, this film remains extremely fun. Why is the film called The Bride of Frankenstein then? Honestly, I can't entirely figure it out myself. The Bride doesn't come until the tail end of the film which was a bit of an issue for me. I would have loved to see some fun, silly, self-aware scenes with The Monster and his Bride but sadly, we don't really get that. Regardless, the film is still a really fun time and might just be better than it's sequel which has only been done a handful of times and really almost never is done in the horror genre.

    BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) is one of the most misogynistic movies of all time! First of all, what kind of a movie is it in which the title character doesn't show up until there is less than five minutes to go? Yet the pale echo of the 1931 classic, in this case, "She's alive, she's alive!" does not occur until one hour, nine and one half minutes into a sequel that lasts just 74 minutes, 42.17 seconds! When the she-monster finally does make her appearance, she comes off as some dumb blonde bimbo, dismissing her designated mate with one glance with prejudicial looksism which denies that handsomeness is only skin deep. Evidentally, she has her cap set for the already-married Dr. Henry Frankenstein, who is obviously the intellectual inferior to the character played so loquaciously by Boris Karloff. But Karloff's monster comes off as a Ted Bundy type, setting a time bomb in motion with these stultifying words to his new bride: "You stay......we belong dead." Since when is murder-suicide romantic?

    There's a lot more comedy in this sequel to "Frankenstein" thanks to the madness of the wacky mad scientist played by Ernest Thesiger here. Somehow the monster escapes from the burning windmill laboratory, scaring the daylights out of the shrill Una O'Connor here. Nowhere in sight at the finale of "Frankenstein", O'Connor (wearing a head piece that looks like it came off of Dr. Frankenstein's wedding cake) dominates much of the film (as does Thesiger), and for once, a change of mood makes the follow-up even better than the original. For "The Bride of Frankenstein" is delightfully campy, utilizing many elements that Mel Brooks couldn't resist overplaying when he wrote his own comic version of the tale "Young Frankenstein" 40 years later. It all starts off with an enjoyable prologue where Elsa Lanchaster, as the real Mary Shelley, tells her pals "Wait, there's more!". The return of the monster brings out the wacky Dr. Pretorious, his collection of tiny creatures (a plot devise stolen for "The Devil Doll" the following year), and the monster's meeting with the blind man. Having seen "Young Frankenstein" more times than this, I couldn't help but quote lines from that ("Wait! I was going to make espresso!") during that sequence, and when Elsa Lanchaster comes back for the final moments as the bride, it not only brought back memories of Madeline Kahn in the Mel Brooks classic but her repeat of the character on "Saturday Night Live" singing "I Feel Pretty". John Carradine, who would go on to horror movie fame in his prime, has a brief appearance here as the hunter who discovers the monster along with the blind man, and "Sherlock Holmes" housekeeper Mary Gordon has a brief walk-on as one of the monster's earlier victims whose demise is almost comical in retrospect. As for Karloff's bringing speech into the monster's life, it is fine for one entry, especially comical for many of the scenes. Artistically, the film is breathtaking to look at, also returning Colin Clive as the doctor, with Valarie Hobson taking over the role of Elizabeth, previously played by Mae Clarke. She gives the character more strength here, standing up to her husband for what she believes his works to be those of Satan.

    On a dark and stormy night, original "Frankenstein" (1918) author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (here impersonated by Elsa Lanchester) discusses her astonishing morality tale with elegant poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. There is a part of her story where the monster appears to have expired, but he manages to survive for more eventful-filled chapters. The movie "Frankenstein" (1931) handled the death and resurrection differently, but will also continue, promises Ms. Shelley. And so, Universal and Carl Laemmle Jr. present her "Bride of Frankenstein"... Lightning strikes twice. This visually stunning motion picture is rightfully regarded as one of the best sequels ever created. They adapted the work exceptionally well - and, most importantly, hired James Whale to return as director. He makes William Hurlbut's screenplay a tapestry of horror weaved with humor. This results in subtext and shadows that continues to breathe new life into an old gem... There is great work from photographer John J. Mescall and art director Charles D. Hall. Franz Waxman's musical score is classic and soundman Gilbert Kurland received an "Oscar" nomination. As their bride, Ms. Lanchester is frightfully ravishing. If there were "Best Supporting Actor" awards in 1935, spectacularly demented mad scientist Ernest Thesiger (as Septimus Pretorius) gives everything you need for some consideration. There are so many levels from which you can enjoy watching, you're guaranteed to enjoy the "Bride of Frankenstein" on one of them. ********** Bride of Frankenstein (4/22/35) James Whale ~ Boris Karloff, Ernest Thesiger, Colin Clive, Elsa Lanchester

Evidentally, she has her cap set for the already-married Dr. Henry Frankenstein, who is obviously the intellectual inferior to the character played so loquaciously by Boris Karloff. But Karloff's monster comes off as a Ted Bundy type, setting a time bomb in motion with these stultifying words to his new bride: "You stay......we belong dead." Since when is murder-suicide romantic?

    There's a lot more comedy in this sequel to "Frankenstein" thanks to the madness of the wacky mad scientist played by Ernest Thesiger here. Somehow the monster escapes from the burning windmill laboratory, scaring the daylights out of the shrill Una O'Connor here. Nowhere in sight at the finale of "Frankenstein", O'Connor (wearing a head piece that looks like it came off of Dr. Frankenstein's wedding cake) dominates much of the film (as does Thesiger), and for once, a change of mood makes the follow-up even better than the original. For "The Bride of Frankenstein" is delightfully campy, utilizing many elements that Mel Brooks couldn't resist overplaying when he wrote his own comic version of the tale "Young Frankenstein" 40 years later. It all starts off with an enjoyable prologue where Elsa Lanchaster, as the real Mary Shelley, tells her pals "Wait, there's more!". The return of the monster brings out the wacky Dr. Pretorious, his collection of tiny creatures (a plot devise stolen for "The Devil Doll" the following year), and the monster's meeting with the blind man. Having seen "Young Frankenstein" more times than this, I couldn't help but quote lines from that ("Wait! I was going to make espresso!") during that sequence, and when Elsa Lanchaster comes back for the final moments as the bride, it not only brought back memories of Madeline Kahn in the Mel Brooks classic but her repeat of the character on "Saturday Night Live" singing "I Feel Pretty". John Carradine, who would go on to horror movie fame in his prime, has a brief appearance here as the hunter who discovers the monster along with the blind man, and "Sherlock Holmes" housekeeper Mary Gordon has a brief walk-on as one of the monster's earlier victims whose demise is almost comical in retrospect. As for Karloff's bringing speech into the monster's life, it is fine for one entry, especially comical for many of the scenes. Artistically, the film is breathtaking to look at, also returning Colin Clive as the doctor, with Valarie Hobson taking over the role of Elizabeth, previously played by Mae Clarke. She gives the character more strength here, standing up to her husband for what she believes his works to be those of Satan.

    On a dark and stormy night, original "Frankenstein" (1918) author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (here impersonated by Elsa Lanchester) discusses her astonishing morality tale with elegant poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. There is a part of her story where the monster appears to have expired, but he manages to survive for more eventful-filled chapters. The movie "Frankenstein" (1931) handled the death and resurrection differently, but will also continue, promises Ms. Shelley. And so, Universal and Carl Laemmle Jr. present her "Bride of Frankenstein"... Lightning strikes twice. This visually stunning motion picture is rightfully regarded as one of the best sequels ever created. They adapted the work exceptionally well - and, most importantly, hired James Whale to return as director. He makes William Hurlbut's screenplay a tapestry of horror weaved with humor. This results in subtext and shadows that continues to breathe new life into an old gem... There is great work from photographer John J. Mescall and art director Charles D. Hall. Franz Waxman's musical score is classic and soundman Gilbert Kurland received an "Oscar" nomination. As their bride, Ms. Lanchester is frightfully ravishing. If there were "Best Supporting Actor" awards in 1935, spectacularly demented mad scientist Ernest Thesiger (as Septimus Pretorius) gives everything you need for some consideration. There are so many levels from which you can enjoy watching, you're guaranteed to enjoy the "Bride of Frankenstein" on one of them. ********** Bride of Frankenstein (4/22/35) James Whale ~ Boris Karloff, Ernest Thesiger, Colin Clive, Elsa Lanchester

    Story Line: When I was starting to watch the film I was thinking "eh this frank overrated thing" I was so so wrong. This film is actually beautiful in it's own way. The story line was amazing 8/10 Cast/Acting Not a problem with any cast or acting I thought they were all good. Scares 2/10 I actually fount this more of a family film then a horror. I even got sad at some points of the film. Location 7/10 The village that everyone lived in was beautiful and vintage as well as the castle looking really Gothic. Best Bit - Frankenstein's monster learning to speak with his "friend" aw that was so cute. Worst bit - No one giving frank's monster a chance. It annoyed me. He only wanted a friend.

    Wow, Frankenstein's not nearly as scary as some of the nightmare architecture. Universal's art department went all out in coming up with castle interiors that look like they came from heck the soaring vaults, the corkscrew staircasesall bathed in semi-darkness like the movie itself. In fact, the whole production's a trip through a visual nightmare. And get a load of that wooden platform rising into the violent heavens like a barge into stormy seas. A great effect. Frankenstein, himself, is more like a backward child than a monster. He'd like to do right but has never been taught how. So he stumbles around looking for a "friend", but lacks the necessary social graces, to say the least. Then too, it doesn't help that his so-called bride (Lanchester), who's not exactly a pin-up herself, takes to him like a vegetarian does to a slab of meat. So, the monster is more like somebody you feel sorry for rather than a scary demon, that is, when he's not tossing people off cliffs or into pits. There's a detectable undercurrent of dark humor throughout, courtesy a crotchety O'Connor and an arch Thesiger. I can see why Universal gave director Whale total charge of the production. He manages a a stylish coherence to both the visual and spoken narrative that indicates a master is in charge. And was it he or maybe Lanchester who came up with those birdlike head jerks that define the monster's so- called bride. In many years of movie viewing, I've seen nothing quite like these weird spasms. No doubt about itthe film's a delicious bite out of the horror sandwich and really deserving of cult status.

    I guess I'm in trouble here. I'm not a fan of this film. It has its moments; for example, the scenes with the monster and the hermit are quite touching. But many parts of the film are simply too "campy". I'm not a fan of mixing genres unless it is clear which genre the film is supposed to be. For example, "Scared Stiff" with Martin & Lewis is clearly comedy. The Abbott & Costello films where they meet horror characters are clearly comedy. But it seems that this film can't decide if it is a horror drama or a horror comedy. The only performance that stands out in my mind is the hermit -- O.P. Heggie. Even Elsa Lanchester's performance is more campy than a serious acting performance. The place for this film to be stored would be in a freak show out in the Arizona desert along old route 66.

    It's easy to see why this sequel to "Frankenstein," in which the monster learns to talk and suffers an unrequited love, has been so often parodied. The story is weird without being especially creepy, the acting outrageously hammy, and the special effects thoroughly dated in a way that's amusing. In order to coerce Victor Frankenstein into building him a bride, the monster crashes into the bedroom of Frankenstein's own fianc&eacute;e and kidnaps her. I forget the comic strip in which the monster, instead of throwing her over his shoulder and running, begins to do her hair, combing and spraying it. But the original story is most thoroughly skewered in Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein," in which all the iconic moments are reduced to slapstick, with the exception of Ernest Thesiger's mad scientist who wears a yarmulke and reduces a horny king and his haughty queen to the size of tin toys. Thesiger turns in the best performance. There are times when he seems to realize he's in what would soon be treated as a source of comedy. Colin Clive, as Frankenstein, doesn't know it so he's all the more effective, shouting classic lines like, "It's alive! Oh, it's ALIVE!" Lionel Atwood is wooden -- all over. Elsa Lanchester has a chance to hiss and twitch and show off her spectacular make up as the bride who, lamentably, finds the monster as ugly as he believes himself to be. It remains a classic though.

    Okay this is a very old time horror film. that means there is no blood and gore like today's horror flicks. Yes, there is death and destruction but done in a very understated manner. Una O'Conner is her usual very irritating self, mainly through her voice but that face doesn't help. Elsa Lancaster ends up as the bride but you never see her get killed by the weirdo. All she seems able to do is hiss at poor ole Frankie when she is reanimated. Boris Karloff is the monster and does a superb job as the actually misunderstood and ignorant monster. It is obvious in some scenes that he is just looking for understanding and sustenance. It is only when his needs are not met that he turns violent (not that I would give a being that looked liked that and couldn't talk an even chance). Young Frankenstein mirrors the blind monk so well and the poor monk is a victim of circumstance rather than a real victim. Don't get me wrong, in real life it needs to die. When the "Bride" rejects the monster and he just goes into a rage and they die it is what can be called poetic justice.

    Along with Tod Browning's 'Dracula' released the same year, the critical and commercial success of James Whale's 'Frankenstein' (1931) was responsible for the horror boom of the Thirties which gave us so many lasting classics like 'The Mummy' (1932) and 'The Black Cat' (1934) as well as Whale's own 'The Old Dark House' (1932) and the astonishing 'The Invisible Man' (1933). Yet, despite this success, Whale's artistic sensibilities meant that he was hesitant to make a sequel and was only lured into the director's chair when granted complete creative control. So, with Colin Clive and Boris Karloff who both reprising their respective roles as Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster, the resulting movie is a quite startling mixture of the kind of hysterical Gothic derangement and commentary on the human condition that characterised the original but which pushes further in playing with religious iconography as well as presenting an overt campness due (in no small part) to the scene-stealing performance of Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius. Like its illustrious predecessor, the movie explores the injustice enacted on the monster after having been given life by a God-playing mad scientist. As before, Karloff puts in a tremendous performance; however, where he articulated the Monster's loneliness and existential uncertainty through movement in the first movie due to the Monster's muteness, in 'Bride of Frankenstein' the Monster has acquired a basic speech capacity which even permits him to form a nascent friendship with a blind old man in one of the movie's many touching scenes. However, the friendship is short-lived and the Monster decides the only way to alleviate his loneliness is for his creator to create a mate, a bride, for him. Fortunately (or not) Dr. Frankenstein has been lured back to his studies by the flamboyant and sexually ambiguous Dr. Pretorius and the Monster's bride (as much a master-stroke of character design and make-up as the Monster himself) is duly brought to life in an animation scene easily the equal of that in 'Frankenstein'. However, a happy ending is not to be. Along with the magnificent performances, the film reprises the German expressionist influenced aesthetic in the sets and cinematography, which effortlessly recreate the sombre and macabre atmosphere which characterised the original. However, a major point of difference is that where the original film had no music, 'Bride of Frankenstein' completes its masterful display of what a horror film should be with a fitting and affecting score. As a result of all this, the film manages to do the impossible: that is, surpass the iconic power of the original and be "better" than a movie which, in itself, is near perfect. Naturally, 'Frankenstein' will get most of the praise on a pop-culture level as it was remarkable in its originality and the freshness of its depth as well as introducing Boris Karloff to the world. However, those who have dug a little deeper recognize that 'Bride of Frankenstein' is easily the equal to the original and stands as one of the best from the Golden Age of horror movies.

    The Bride of Frankenstein is an interesting sequel to say the least. It starts off by breaking the forth wall essentially and having an actress (Elsa Lanchester) play the author of the Frankenstein novel which leads to her saying she has more of a story to tell. We then get a few scenes from the original Frankenstein film which sums up some aspects of the film and then we are led right into the events immediately after. The Monster has lived as well as Henry Frankenstein. Does it feel a bit cheap? Yeah, I guess so but I've always given the horror genre the benefit of the doubt with sequels. And it doesn't matter because this film works really well for the most part. It is filled with fun, campy, over the top performances that keep the film highly entertaining. In general, the film seems to be self-aware and is somewhat a self-parody of the previous Universal horror flicks. Most of the film is really The Monster running into other people and having strange, awkward, and comical encounters with them. From The Monster eventually learning to talk to accidentally killing people in rage, this film remains extremely fun. Why is the film called The Bride of Frankenstein then? Honestly, I can't entirely figure it out myself. The Bride doesn't come until the tail end of the film which was a bit of an issue for me. I would have loved to see some fun, silly, self-aware scenes with The Monster and his Bride but sadly, we don't really get that. Regardless, the film is still a really fun time and might just be better than it's sequel which has only been done a handful of times and really almost never is done in the horror genre.

    BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) is one of the most misogynistic movies of all time! First of all, what kind of a movie is it in which the title character doesn't show up until there is less than five minutes to go? Yet the pale echo of the 1931 classic, in this case, "She's alive, she's alive!" does not occur until one hour, nine and one half minutes into a sequel that lasts just 74 minutes, 42.17 seconds! When the she-monster finally does make her appearance, she comes off as some dumb blonde bimbo, dismissing her designated mate with one glance with prejudicial looksism which denies that handsomeness is only skin deep. Evidentally, she has her cap set for the already-married Dr. Henry Frankenstein, who is obviously the intellectual inferior to the character played so loquaciously by Boris Karloff.

As before, Karloff puts in a tremendous performance; however, where he articulated the Monster's loneliness and existential uncertainty through movement in the first movie due to the Monster's muteness, in 'Bride of Frankenstein' the Monster has acquired a basic speech capacity which even permits him to form a nascent friendship with a blind old man in one of the movie's many touching scenes. However, the friendship is short-lived and the Monster decides the only way to alleviate his loneliness is for his creator to create a mate, a bride, for him. Fortunately (or not) Dr. Frankenstein has been lured back to his studies by the flamboyant and sexually ambiguous Dr. Pretorius and the Monster's bride (as much a master-stroke of character design and make-up as the Monster himself) is duly brought to life in an animation scene easily the equal of that in 'Frankenstein'. However, a happy ending is not to be. Along with the magnificent performances, the film reprises the German expressionist influenced aesthetic in the sets and cinematography, which effortlessly recreate the sombre and macabre atmosphere which characterised the original. However, a major point of difference is that where the original film had no music, 'Bride of Frankenstein' completes its masterful display of what a horror film should be with a fitting and affecting score. As a result of all this, the film manages to do the impossible: that is, surpass the iconic power of the original and be "better" than a movie which, in itself, is near perfect. Naturally, 'Frankenstein' will get most of the praise on a pop-culture level as it was remarkable in its originality and the freshness of its depth as well as introducing Boris Karloff to the world. However, those who have dug a little deeper recognize that 'Bride of Frankenstein' is easily the equal to the original and stands as one of the best from the Golden Age of horror movies.

    The Bride of Frankenstein is an interesting sequel to say the least. It starts off by breaking the forth wall essentially and having an actress (Elsa Lanchester) play the author of the Frankenstein novel which leads to her saying she has more of a story to tell. We then get a few scenes from the original Frankenstein film which sums up some aspects of the film and then we are led right into the events immediately after. The Monster has lived as well as Henry Frankenstein. Does it feel a bit cheap? Yeah, I guess so but I've always given the horror genre the benefit of the doubt with sequels. And it doesn't matter because this film works really well for the most part. It is filled with fun, campy, over the top performances that keep the film highly entertaining. In general, the film seems to be self-aware and is somewhat a self-parody of the previous Universal horror flicks. Most of the film is really The Monster running into other people and having strange, awkward, and comical encounters with them. From The Monster eventually learning to talk to accidentally killing people in rage, this film remains extremely fun. Why is the film called The Bride of Frankenstein then? Honestly, I can't entirely figure it out myself. The Bride doesn't come until the tail end of the film which was a bit of an issue for me. I would have loved to see some fun, silly, self-aware scenes with The Monster and his Bride but sadly, we don't really get that. Regardless, the film is still a really fun time and might just be better than it's sequel which has only been done a handful of times and really almost never is done in the horror genre.

    BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) is one of the most misogynistic movies of all time! First of all, what kind of a movie is it in which the title character doesn't show up until there is less than five minutes to go? Yet the pale echo of the 1931 classic, in this case, "She's alive, she's alive!" does not occur until one hour, nine and one half minutes into a sequel that lasts just 74 minutes, 42.17 seconds! When the she-monster finally does make her appearance, she comes off as some dumb blonde bimbo, dismissing her designated mate with one glance with prejudicial looksism which denies that handsomeness is only skin deep. Evidentally, she has her cap set for the already-married Dr. Henry Frankenstein, who is obviously the intellectual inferior to the character played so loquaciously by Boris Karloff. But Karloff's monster comes off as a Ted Bundy type, setting a time bomb in motion with these stultifying words to his new bride: "You stay......we belong dead." Since when is murder-suicide romantic?

    There's a lot more comedy in this sequel to "Frankenstein" thanks to the madness of the wacky mad scientist played by Ernest Thesiger here. Somehow the monster escapes from the burning windmill laboratory, scaring the daylights out of the shrill Una O'Connor here. Nowhere in sight at the finale of "Frankenstein", O'Connor (wearing a head piece that looks like it came off of Dr. Frankenstein's wedding cake) dominates much of the film (as does Thesiger), and for once, a change of mood makes the follow-up even better than the original. For "The Bride of Frankenstein" is delightfully campy, utilizing many elements that Mel Brooks couldn't resist overplaying when he wrote his own comic version of the tale "Young Frankenstein" 40 years later. It all starts off with an enjoyable prologue where Elsa Lanchaster, as the real Mary Shelley, tells her pals "Wait, there's more!". The return of the monster brings out the wacky Dr. Pretorious, his collection of tiny creatures (a plot devise stolen for "The Devil Doll" the following year), and the monster's meeting with the blind man. Having seen "Young Frankenstein" more times than this, I couldn't help but quote lines from that ("Wait! I was going to make espresso!") during that sequence, and when Elsa Lanchaster comes back for the final moments as the bride, it not only brought back memories of Madeline Kahn in the Mel Brooks classic but her repeat of the character on "Saturday Night Live" singing "I Feel Pretty". John Carradine, who would go on to horror movie fame in his prime, has a brief appearance here as the hunter who discovers the monster along with the blind man, and "Sherlock Holmes" housekeeper Mary Gordon has a brief walk-on as one of the monster's earlier victims whose demise is almost comical in retrospect. As for Karloff's bringing speech into the monster's life, it is fine for one entry, especially comical for many of the scenes. Artistically, the film is breathtaking to look at, also returning Colin Clive as the doctor, with Valarie Hobson taking over the role of Elizabeth, previously played by Mae Clarke. She gives the character more strength here, standing up to her husband for what she believes his works to be those of Satan.

    On a dark and stormy night, original "Frankenstein" (1918) author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (here impersonated by Elsa Lanchester) discusses her astonishing morality tale with elegant poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. There is a part of her story where the monster appears to have expired, but he manages to survive for more eventful-filled chapters. The movie "Frankenstein" (1931) handled the death and resurrection differently, but will also continue, promises Ms. Shelley. And so, Universal and Carl Laemmle Jr. present her "Bride of Frankenstein"... Lightning strikes twice. This visually stunning motion picture is rightfully regarded as one of the best sequels ever created. They adapted the work exceptionally well - and, most importantly, hired James Whale to return as director. He makes William Hurlbut's screenplay a tapestry of horror weaved with humor. This results in subtext and shadows that continues to breathe new life into an old gem... There is great work from photographer John J. Mescall and art director Charles D. Hall. Franz Waxman's musical score is classic and soundman Gilbert Kurland received an "Oscar" nomination. As their bride, Ms. Lanchester is frightfully ravishing. If there were "Best Supporting Actor" awards in 1935, spectacularly demented mad scientist Ernest Thesiger (as Septimus Pretorius) gives everything you need for some consideration. There are so many levels from which you can enjoy watching, you're guaranteed to enjoy the "Bride of Frankenstein" on one of them. ********** Bride of Frankenstein (4/22/35) James Whale ~ Boris Karloff, Ernest Thesiger, Colin Clive, Elsa Lanchester

    Story Line: When I was starting to watch the film I was thinking "eh this frank overrated thing" I was so so wrong. This film is actually beautiful in it's own way. The story line was amazing 8/10 Cast/Acting Not a problem with any cast or acting I thought they were all good. Scares 2/10 I actually fount this more of a family film then a horror. I even got sad at some points of the film. Location 7/10 The village that everyone lived in was beautiful and vintage as well as the castle looking really Gothic. Best Bit - Frankenstein's monster learning to speak with his "friend" aw that was so cute. Worst bit - No one giving frank's monster a chance. It annoyed me. He only wanted a friend.

    Wow, Frankenstein's not nearly as scary as some of the nightmare architecture. Universal's art department went all out in coming up with castle interiors that look like they came from heck the soaring vaults, the corkscrew staircasesall bathed in semi-darkness like the movie itself. In fact, the whole production's a trip through a visual nightmare. And get a load of that wooden platform rising into the violent heavens like a barge into stormy seas. A great effect. Frankenstein, himself, is more like a backward child than a monster. He'd like to do right but has never been taught how. So he stumbles around looking for a "friend", but lacks the necessary social graces, to say the least. Then too, it doesn't help that his so-called bride (Lanchester), who's not exactly a pin-up herself, takes to him like a vegetarian does to a slab of meat. So, the monster is more like somebody you feel sorry for rather than a scary demon, that is, when he's not tossing people off cliffs or into pits. There's a detectable undercurrent of dark humor throughout, courtesy a crotchety O'Connor and an arch Thesiger. I can see why Universal gave director Whale total charge of the production. He manages a a stylish coherence to both the visual and spoken narrative that indicates a master is in charge. And was it he or maybe Lanchester who came up with those birdlike head jerks that define the monster's so- called bride. In many years of movie viewing, I've seen nothing quite like these weird spasms. No doubt about itthe film's a delicious bite out of the horror sandwich and really deserving of cult status.

    I guess I'm in trouble here. I'm not a fan of this film. It has its moments; for example, the scenes with the monster and the hermit are quite touching. But many parts of the film are simply too "campy". I'm not a fan of mixing genres unless it is clear which genre the film is supposed to be. For example, "Scared Stiff" with Martin & Lewis is clearly comedy. The Abbott & Costello films where they meet horror characters are clearly comedy. But it seems that this film can't decide if it is a horror drama or a horror comedy. The only performance that stands out in my mind is the hermit -- O.P. Heggie. Even Elsa Lanchester's performance is more campy than a serious acting performance. The place for this film to be stored would be in a freak show out in the Arizona desert along old route 66.

    It's easy to see why this sequel to "Frankenstein," in which the monster learns to talk and suffers an unrequited love, has been so often parodied. The story is weird without being especially creepy, the acting outrageously hammy, and the special effects thoroughly dated in a way that's amusing. In order to coerce Victor Frankenstein into building him a bride, the monster crashes into the bedroom of Frankenstein's own fianc&eacute;e and kidnaps her. I forget the comic strip in which the monster, instead of throwing her over his shoulder and running, begins to do her hair, combing and spraying it. But the original story is most thoroughly skewered in Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein," in which all the iconic moments are reduced to slapstick, with the exception of Ernest Thesiger's mad scientist who wears a yarmulke and reduces a horny king and his haughty queen to the size of tin toys. Thesiger turns in the best performance. There are times when he seems to realize he's in what would soon be treated as a source of comedy. Colin Clive, as Frankenstein, doesn't know it so he's all the more effective, shouting classic lines like, "It's alive! Oh, it's ALIVE!" Lionel Atwood is wooden -- all over. Elsa Lanchester has a chance to hiss and twitch and show off her spectacular make up as the bride who, lamentably, finds the monster as ugly as he believes himself to be. It remains a classic though.

    Okay this is a very old time horror film. that means there is no blood and gore like today's horror flicks. Yes, there is death and destruction but done in a very understated manner. Una O'Conner is her usual very irritating self, mainly through her voice but that face doesn't help. Elsa Lancaster ends up as the bride but you never see her get killed by the weirdo. All she seems able to do is hiss at poor ole Frankie when she is reanimated. Boris Karloff is the monster and does a superb job as the actually misunderstood and ignorant monster. It is obvious in some scenes that he is just looking for understanding and sustenance. It is only when his needs are not met that he turns violent (not that I would give a being that looked liked that and couldn't talk an even chance). Young Frankenstein mirrors the blind monk so well and the poor monk is a victim of circumstance rather than a real victim. Don't get me wrong, in real life it needs to die. When the "Bride" rejects the monster and he just goes into a rage and they die it is what can be called poetic justice.

    Along with Tod Browning's 'Dracula' released the same year, the critical and commercial success of James Whale's 'Frankenstein' (1931) was responsible for the horror boom of the Thirties which gave us so many lasting classics like 'The Mummy' (1932) and 'The Black Cat' (1934) as well as Whale's own 'The Old Dark House' (1932) and the astonishing 'The Invisible Man' (1933). Yet, despite this success, Whale's artistic sensibilities meant that he was hesitant to make a sequel and was only lured into the director's chair when granted complete creative control. So, with Colin Clive and Boris Karloff who both reprising their respective roles as Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster, the resulting movie is a quite startling mixture of the kind of hysterical Gothic derangement and commentary on the human condition that characterised the original but which pushes further in playing with religious iconography as well as presenting an overt campness due (in no small part) to the scene-stealing performance of Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius.

    It's easy to see why this sequel to "Frankenstein," in which the monster learns to talk and suffers an unrequited love, has been so often parodied. The story is weird without being especially creepy, the acting outrageously hammy, and the special effects thoroughly dated in a way that's amusing. In order to coerce Victor Frankenstein into building him a bride, the monster crashes into the bedroom of Frankenstein's own fianc&eacute;e and kidnaps her. I forget the comic strip in which the monster, instead of throwing her over his shoulder and running, begins to do her hair, combing and spraying it. But the original story is most thoroughly skewered in Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein," in which all the iconic moments are reduced to slapstick, with the exception of Ernest Thesiger's mad scientist who wears a yarmulke and reduces a horny king and his haughty queen to the size of tin toys. Thesiger turns in the best performance. There are times when he seems to realize he's in what would soon be treated as a source of comedy. Colin Clive, as Frankenstein, doesn't know it so he's all the more effective, shouting classic lines like, "It's alive! Oh, it's ALIVE!" Lionel Atwood is wooden -- all over. Elsa Lanchester has a chance to hiss and twitch and show off her spectacular make up as the bride who, lamentably, finds the monster as ugly as he believes himself to be. It remains a classic though.

    Okay this is a very old time horror film. that means there is no blood and gore like today's horror flicks. Yes, there is death and destruction but done in a very understated manner. Una O'Conner is her usual very irritating self, mainly through her voice but that face doesn't help. Elsa Lancaster ends up as the bride but you never see her get killed by the weirdo. All she seems able to do is hiss at poor ole Frankie when she is reanimated. Boris Karloff is the monster and does a superb job as the actually misunderstood and ignorant monster. It is obvious in some scenes that he is just looking for understanding and sustenance. It is only when his needs are not met that he turns violent (not that I would give a being that looked liked that and couldn't talk an even chance). Young Frankenstein mirrors the blind monk so well and the poor monk is a victim of circumstance rather than a real victim. Don't get me wrong, in real life it needs to die. When the "Bride" rejects the monster and he just goes into a rage and they die it is what can be called poetic justice.

    Along with Tod Browning's 'Dracula' released the same year, the critical and commercial success of James Whale's 'Frankenstein' (1931) was responsible for the horror boom of the Thirties which gave us so many lasting classics like 'The Mummy' (1932) and 'The Black Cat' (1934) as well as Whale's own 'The Old Dark House' (1932) and the astonishing 'The Invisible Man' (1933). Yet, despite this success, Whale's artistic sensibilities meant that he was hesitant to make a sequel and was only lured into the director's chair when granted complete creative control. So, with Colin Clive and Boris Karloff who both reprising their respective roles as Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster, the resulting movie is a quite startling mixture of the kind of hysterical Gothic derangement and commentary on the human condition that characterised the original but which pushes further in playing with religious iconography as well as presenting an overt campness due (in no small part) to the scene-stealing performance of Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius. Like its illustrious predecessor, the movie explores the injustice enacted on the monster after having been given life by a God-playing mad scientist. As before, Karloff puts in a tremendous performance; however, where he articulated the Monster's loneliness and existential uncertainty through movement in the first movie due to the Monster's muteness, in 'Bride of Frankenstein' the Monster has acquired a basic speech capacity which even permits him to form a nascent friendship with a blind old man in one of the movie's many touching scenes. However, the friendship is short-lived and the Monster decides the only way to alleviate his loneliness is for his creator to create a mate, a bride, for him. Fortunately (or not) Dr. Frankenstein has been lured back to his studies by the flamboyant and sexually ambiguous Dr. Pretorius and the Monster's bride (as much a master-stroke of character design and make-up as the Monster himself) is duly brought to life in an animation scene easily the equal of that in 'Frankenstein'. However, a happy ending is not to be. Along with the magnificent performances, the film reprises the German expressionist influenced aesthetic in the sets and cinematography, which effortlessly recreate the sombre and macabre atmosphere which characterised the original. However, a major point of difference is that where the original film had no music, 'Bride of Frankenstein' completes its masterful display of what a horror film should be with a fitting and affecting score. As a result of all this, the film manages to do the impossible: that is, surpass the iconic power of the original and be "better" than a movie which, in itself, is near perfect. Naturally, 'Frankenstein' will get most of the praise on a pop-culture level as it was remarkable in its originality and the freshness of its depth as well as introducing Boris Karloff to the world. However, those who have dug a little deeper recognize that 'Bride of Frankenstein' is easily the equal to the original and stands as one of the best from the Golden Age of horror movies.

    The Bride of Frankenstein is an interesting sequel to say the least. It starts off by breaking the forth wall essentially and having an actress (Elsa Lanchester) play the author of the Frankenstein novel which leads to her saying she has more of a story to tell. We then get a few scenes from the original Frankenstein film which sums up some aspects of the film and then we are led right into the events immediately after. The Monster has lived as well as Henry Frankenstein. Does it feel a bit cheap? Yeah, I guess so but I've always given the horror genre the benefit of the doubt with sequels. And it doesn't matter because this film works really well for the most part. It is filled with fun, campy, over the top performances that keep the film highly entertaining. In general, the film seems to be self-aware and is somewhat a self-parody of the previous Universal horror flicks. Most of the film is really The Monster running into other people and having strange, awkward, and comical encounters with them. From The Monster eventually learning to talk to accidentally killing people in rage, this film remains extremely fun. Why is the film called The Bride of Frankenstein then? Honestly, I can't entirely figure it out myself. The Bride doesn't come until the tail end of the film which was a bit of an issue for me. I would have loved to see some fun, silly, self-aware scenes with The Monster and his Bride but sadly, we don't really get that. Regardless, the film is still a really fun time and might just be better than it's sequel which has only been done a handful of times and really almost never is done in the horror genre.

    BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) is one of the most misogynistic movies of all time! First of all, what kind of a movie is it in which the title character doesn't show up until there is less than five minutes to go? Yet the pale echo of the 1931 classic, in this case, "She's alive, she's alive!" does not occur until one hour, nine and one half minutes into a sequel that lasts just 74 minutes, 42.17 seconds! When the she-monster finally does make her appearance, she comes off as some dumb blonde bimbo, dismissing her designated mate with one glance with prejudicial looksism which denies that handsomeness is only skin deep. Evidentally, she has her cap set for the already-married Dr. Henry Frankenstein, who is obviously the intellectual inferior to the character played so loquaciously by Boris Karloff. But Karloff's monster comes off as a Ted Bundy type, setting a time bomb in motion with these stultifying words to his new bride: "You stay......we belong dead." Since when is murder-suicide romantic?

    There's a lot more comedy in this sequel to "Frankenstein" thanks to the madness of the wacky mad scientist played by Ernest Thesiger here. Somehow the monster escapes from the burning windmill laboratory, scaring the daylights out of the shrill Una O'Connor here. Nowhere in sight at the finale of "Frankenstein", O'Connor (wearing a head piece that looks like it came off of Dr. Frankenstein's wedding cake) dominates much of the film (as does Thesiger), and for once, a change of mood makes the follow-up even better than the original. For "The Bride of Frankenstein" is delightfully campy, utilizing many elements that Mel Brooks couldn't resist overplaying when he wrote his own comic version of the tale "Young Frankenstein" 40 years later. It all starts off with an enjoyable prologue where Elsa Lanchaster, as the real Mary Shelley, tells her pals "Wait, there's more!". The return of the monster brings out the wacky Dr. Pretorious, his collection of tiny creatures (a plot devise stolen for "The Devil Doll" the following year), and the monster's meeting with the blind man. Having seen "Young Frankenstein" more times than this, I couldn't help but quote lines from that ("Wait! I was going to make espresso!") during that sequence, and when Elsa Lanchaster comes back for the final moments as the bride, it not only brought back memories of Madeline Kahn in the Mel Brooks classic but her repeat of the character on "Saturday Night Live" singing "I Feel Pretty". John Carradine, who would go on to horror movie fame in his prime, has a brief appearance here as the hunter who discovers the monster along with the blind man, and "Sherlock Holmes" housekeeper Mary Gordon has a brief walk-on as one of the monster's earlier victims whose demise is almost comical in retrospect. As for Karloff's bringing speech into the monster's life, it is fine for one entry, especially comical for many of the scenes. Artistically, the film is breathtaking to look at, also returning Colin Clive as the doctor, with Valarie Hobson taking over the role of Elizabeth, previously played by Mae Clarke. She gives the character more strength here, standing up to her husband for what she believes his works to be those of Satan.

    On a dark and stormy night, original "Frankenstein" (1918) author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (here impersonated by Elsa Lanchester) discusses her astonishing morality tale with elegant poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. There is a part of her story where the monster appears to have expired, but he manages to survive for more eventful-filled chapters. The movie "Frankenstein" (1931) handled the death and resurrection differently, but will also continue, promises Ms. Shelley. And so, Universal and Carl Laemmle Jr. present her "Bride of Frankenstein"... Lightning strikes twice. This visually stunning motion picture is rightfully regarded as one of the best sequels ever created. They adapted the work exceptionally well - and, most importantly, hired James Whale to return as director. He makes William Hurlbut's screenplay a tapestry of horror weaved with humor. This results in subtext and shadows that continues to breathe new life into an old gem... There is great work from photographer John J. Mescall and art director Charles D. Hall. Franz Waxman's musical score is classic and soundman Gilbert Kurland received an "Oscar" nomination. As their bride, Ms. Lanchester is frightfully ravishing. If there were "Best Supporting Actor" awards in 1935, spectacularly demented mad scientist Ernest Thesiger (as Septimus Pretorius) gives everything you need for some consideration. There are so many levels from which you can enjoy watching, you're guaranteed to enjoy the "Bride of Frankenstein" on one of them. ********** Bride of Frankenstein (4/22/35) James Whale ~ Boris Karloff, Ernest Thesiger, Colin Clive, Elsa Lanchester

    Story Line: When I was starting to watch the film I was thinking "eh this frank overrated thing" I was so so wrong. This film is actually beautiful in it's own way. The story line was amazing 8/10 Cast/Acting Not a problem with any cast or acting I thought they were all good. Scares 2/10 I actually fount this more of a family film then a horror. I even got sad at some points of the film. Location 7/10 The village that everyone lived in was beautiful and vintage as well as the castle looking really Gothic. Best Bit - Frankenstein's monster learning to speak with his "friend" aw that was so cute. Worst bit - No one giving frank's monster a chance. It annoyed me. He only wanted a friend.

    Wow, Frankenstein's not nearly as scary as some of the nightmare architecture. Universal's art department went all out in coming up with castle interiors that look like they came from heck the soaring vaults, the corkscrew staircasesall bathed in semi-darkness like the movie itself. In fact, the whole production's a trip through a visual nightmare. And get a load of that wooden platform rising into the violent heavens like a barge into stormy seas. A great effect. Frankenstein, himself, is more like a backward child than a monster. He'd like to do right but has never been taught how. So he stumbles around looking for a "friend", but lacks the necessary social graces, to say the least. Then too, it doesn't help that his so-called bride (Lanchester), who's not exactly a pin-up herself, takes to him like a vegetarian does to a slab of meat. So, the monster is more like somebody you feel sorry for rather than a scary demon, that is, when he's not tossing people off cliffs or into pits. There's a detectable undercurrent of dark humor throughout, courtesy a crotchety O'Connor and an arch Thesiger. I can see why Universal gave director Whale total charge of the production. He manages a a stylish coherence to both the visual and spoken narrative that indicates a master is in charge. And was it he or maybe Lanchester who came up with those birdlike head jerks that define the monster's so- called bride. In many years of movie viewing, I've seen nothing quite like these weird spasms. No doubt about itthe film's a delicious bite out of the horror sandwich and really deserving of cult status.

    I guess I'm in trouble here. I'm not a fan of this film. It has its moments; for example, the scenes with the monster and the hermit are quite touching. But many parts of the film are simply too "campy". I'm not a fan of mixing genres unless it is clear which genre the film is supposed to be. For example, "Scared Stiff" with Martin & Lewis is clearly comedy. The Abbott & Costello films where they meet horror characters are clearly comedy. But it seems that this film can't decide if it is a horror drama or a horror comedy. The only performance that stands out in my mind is the hermit -- O.P. Heggie. Even Elsa Lanchester's performance is more campy than a serious acting performance. The place for this film to be stored would be in a freak show out in the Arizona desert along old route 66.

    Story Line: When I was starting to watch the film I was thinking "eh this frank overrated thing" I was so so wrong. This film is actually beautiful in it's own way. The story line was amazing 8/10 Cast/Acting Not a problem with any cast or acting I thought they were all good. Scares 2/10 I actually fount this more of a family film then a horror. I even got sad at some points of the film. Location 7/10 The village that everyone lived in was beautiful and vintage as well as the castle looking really Gothic. Best Bit - Frankenstein's monster learning to speak with his "friend" aw that was so cute. Worst bit - No one giving frank's monster a chance. It annoyed me. He only wanted a friend.

    Wow, Frankenstein's not nearly as scary as some of the nightmare architecture. Universal's art department went all out in coming up with castle interiors that look like they came from heck the soaring vaults, the corkscrew staircasesall bathed in semi-darkness like the movie itself. In fact, the whole production's a trip through a visual nightmare. And get a load of that wooden platform rising into the violent heavens like a barge into stormy seas. A great effect. Frankenstein, himself, is more like a backward child than a monster. He'd like to do right but has never been taught how. So he stumbles around looking for a "friend", but lacks the necessary social graces, to say the least. Then too, it doesn't help that his so-called bride (Lanchester), who's not exactly a pin-up herself, takes to him like a vegetarian does to a slab of meat. So, the monster is more like somebody you feel sorry for rather than a scary demon, that is, when he's not tossing people off cliffs or into pits. There's a detectable undercurrent of dark humor throughout, courtesy a crotchety O'Connor and an arch Thesiger. I can see why Universal gave director Whale total charge of the production. He manages a a stylish coherence to both the visual and spoken narrative that indicates a master is in charge. And was it he or maybe Lanchester who came up with those birdlike head jerks that define the monster's so- called bride. In many years of movie viewing, I've seen nothing quite like these weird spasms. No doubt about itthe film's a delicious bite out of the horror sandwich and really deserving of cult status.

    I guess I'm in trouble here. I'm not a fan of this film. It has its moments; for example, the scenes with the monster and the hermit are quite touching. But many parts of the film are simply too "campy". I'm not a fan of mixing genres unless it is clear which genre the film is supposed to be. For example, "Scared Stiff" with Martin & Lewis is clearly comedy. The Abbott & Costello films where they meet horror characters are clearly comedy. But it seems that this film can't decide if it is a horror drama or a horror comedy. The only performance that stands out in my mind is the hermit -- O.P. Heggie. Even Elsa Lanchester's performance is more campy than a serious acting performance. The place for this film to be stored would be in a freak show out in the Arizona desert along old route 66.

    It's easy to see why this sequel to "Frankenstein," in which the monster learns to talk and suffers an unrequited love, has been so often parodied. The story is weird without being especially creepy, the acting outrageously hammy, and the special effects thoroughly dated in a way that's amusing. In order to coerce Victor Frankenstein into building him a bride, the monster crashes into the bedroom of Frankenstein's own fianc&eacute;e and kidnaps her. I forget the comic strip in which the monster, instead of throwing her over his shoulder and running, begins to do her hair, combing and spraying it. But the original story is most thoroughly skewered in Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein," in which all the iconic moments are reduced to slapstick, with the exception of Ernest Thesiger's mad scientist who wears a yarmulke and reduces a horny king and his haughty queen to the size of tin toys. Thesiger turns in the best performance. There are times when he seems to realize he's in what would soon be treated as a source of comedy. Colin Clive, as Frankenstein, doesn't know it so he's all the more effective, shouting classic lines like, "It's alive! Oh, it's ALIVE!" Lionel Atwood is wooden -- all over. Elsa Lanchester has a chance to hiss and twitch and show off her spectacular make up as the bride who, lamentably, finds the monster as ugly as he believes himself to be. It remains a classic though.

    Okay this is a very old time horror film. that means there is no blood and gore like today's horror flicks. Yes, there is death and destruction but done in a very understated manner. Una O'Conner is her usual very irritating self, mainly through her voice but that face doesn't help. Elsa Lancaster ends up as the bride but you never see her get killed by the weirdo. All she seems able to do is hiss at poor ole Frankie when she is reanimated. Boris Karloff is the monster and does a superb job as the actually misunderstood and ignorant monster. It is obvious in some scenes that he is just looking for understanding and sustenance. It is only when his needs are not met that he turns violent (not that I would give a being that looked liked that and couldn't talk an even chance). Young Frankenstein mirrors the blind monk so well and the poor monk is a victim of circumstance rather than a real victim. Don't get me wrong, in real life it needs to die. When the "Bride" rejects the monster and he just goes into a rage and they die it is what can be called poetic justice.

    Along with Tod Browning's 'Dracula' released the same year, the critical and commercial success of James Whale's 'Frankenstein' (1931) was responsible for the horror boom of the Thirties which gave us so many lasting classics like 'The Mummy' (1932) and 'The Black Cat' (1934) as well as Whale's own 'The Old Dark House' (1932) and the astonishing 'The Invisible Man' (1933). Yet, despite this success, Whale's artistic sensibilities meant that he was hesitant to make a sequel and was only lured into the director's chair when granted complete creative control. So, with Colin Clive and Boris Karloff who both reprising their respective roles as Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster, the resulting movie is a quite startling mixture of the kind of hysterical Gothic derangement and commentary on the human condition that characterised the original but which pushes further in playing with religious iconography as well as presenting an overt campness due (in no small part) to the scene-stealing performance of Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius. Like its illustrious predecessor, the movie explores the injustice enacted on the monster after having been given life by a God-playing mad scientist. As before, Karloff puts in a tremendous performance; however, where he articulated the Monster's loneliness and existential uncertainty through movement in the first movie due to the Monster's muteness, in 'Bride of Frankenstein' the Monster has acquired a basic speech capacity which even permits him to form a nascent friendship with a blind old man in one of the movie's many touching scenes. However, the friendship is short-lived and the Monster decides the only way to alleviate his loneliness is for his creator to create a mate, a bride, for him. Fortunately (or not) Dr. Frankenstein has been lured back to his studies by the flamboyant and sexually ambiguous Dr. Pretorius and the Monster's bride (as much a master-stroke of character design and make-up as the Monster himself) is duly brought to life in an animation scene easily the equal of that in 'Frankenstein'. However, a happy ending is not to be. Along with the magnificent performances, the film reprises the German expressionist influenced aesthetic in the sets and cinematography, which effortlessly recreate the sombre and macabre atmosphere which characterised the original. However, a major point of difference is that where the original film had no music, 'Bride of Frankenstein' completes its masterful display of what a horror film should be with a fitting and affecting score. As a result of all this, the film manages to do the impossible: that is, surpass the iconic power of the original and be "better" than a movie which, in itself, is near perfect. Naturally, 'Frankenstein' will get most of the praise on a pop-culture level as it was remarkable in its originality and the freshness of its depth as well as introducing Boris Karloff to the world. However, those who have dug a little deeper recognize that 'Bride of Frankenstein' is easily the equal to the original and stands as one of the best from the Golden Age of horror movies.

    The Bride of Frankenstein is an interesting sequel to say the least. It starts off by breaking the forth wall essentially and having an actress (Elsa Lanchester) play the author of the Frankenstein novel which leads to her saying she has more of a story to tell. We then get a few scenes from the original Frankenstein film which sums up some aspects of the film and then we are led right into the events immediately after. The Monster has lived as well as Henry Frankenstein. Does it feel a bit cheap? Yeah, I guess so but I've always given the horror genre the benefit of the doubt with sequels. And it doesn't matter because this film works really well for the most part. It is filled with fun, campy, over the top performances that keep the film highly entertaining. In general, the film seems to be self-aware and is somewhat a self-parody of the previous Universal horror flicks. Most of the film is really The Monster running into other people and having strange, awkward, and comical encounters with them. From The Monster eventually learning to talk to accidentally killing people in rage, this film remains extremely fun. Why is the film called The Bride of Frankenstein then? Honestly, I can't entirely figure it out myself. The Bride doesn't come until the tail end of the film which was a bit of an issue for me. I would have loved to see some fun, silly, self-aware scenes with The Monster and his Bride but sadly, we don't really get that. Regardless, the film is still a really fun time and might just be better than it's sequel which has only been done a handful of times and really almost never is done in the horror genre.

    BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) is one of the most misogynistic movies of all time! First of all, what kind of a movie is it in which the title character doesn't show up until there is less than five minutes to go? Yet the pale echo of the 1931 classic, in this case, "She's alive, she's alive!" does not occur until one hour, nine and one half minutes into a sequel that lasts just 74 minutes, 42.17 seconds! When the she-monster finally does make her appearance, she comes off as some dumb blonde bimbo, dismissing her designated mate with one glance with prejudicial looksism which denies that handsomeness is only skin deep. Evidentally, she has her cap set for the already-married Dr. Henry Frankenstein, who is obviously the intellectual inferior to the character played so loquaciously by Boris Karloff. But Karloff's monster comes off as a Ted Bundy type, setting a time bomb in motion with these stultifying words to his new bride: "You stay......we belong dead." Since when is murder-suicide romantic?

    There's a lot more comedy in this sequel to "Frankenstein" thanks to the madness of the wacky mad scientist played by Ernest Thesiger here. Somehow the monster escapes from the burning windmill laboratory, scaring the daylights out of the shrill Una O'Connor here. Nowhere in sight at the finale of "Frankenstein", O'Connor (wearing a head piece that looks like it came off of Dr. Frankenstein's wedding cake) dominates much of the film (as does Thesiger), and for once, a change of mood makes the follow-up even better than the original. For "The Bride of Frankenstein" is delightfully campy, utilizing many elements that Mel Brooks couldn't resist overplaying when he wrote his own comic version of the tale "Young Frankenstein" 40 years later. It all starts off with an enjoyable prologue where Elsa Lanchaster, as the real Mary Shelley, tells her pals "Wait, there's more!". The return of the monster brings out the wacky Dr. Pretorious, his collection of tiny creatures (a plot devise stolen for "The Devil Doll" the following year), and the monster's meeting with the blind man. Having seen "Young Frankenstein" more times than this, I couldn't help but quote lines from that ("Wait! I was going to make espresso!") during that sequence, and when Elsa Lanchaster comes back for the final moments as the bride, it not only brought back memories of Madeline Kahn in the Mel Brooks classic but her repeat of the character on "Saturday Night Live" singing "I Feel Pretty". John Carradine, who would go on to horror movie fame in his prime, has a brief appearance here as the hunter who discovers the monster along with the blind man, and "Sherlock Holmes" housekeeper Mary Gordon has a brief walk-on as one of the monster's earlier victims whose demise is almost comical in retrospect. As for Karloff's bringing speech into the monster's life, it is fine for one entry, especially comical for many of the scenes. Artistically, the film is breathtaking to look at, also returning Colin Clive as the doctor, with Valarie Hobson taking over the role of Elizabeth, previously played by Mae Clarke. She gives the character more strength here, standing up to her husband for what she believes his works to be those of Satan.

    On a dark and stormy night, original "Frankenstein" (1918) author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (here impersonated by Elsa Lanchester) discusses her astonishing morality tale with elegant poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. There is a part of her story where the monster appears to have expired, but he manages to survive for more eventful-filled chapters. The movie "Frankenstein" (1931) handled the death and resurrection differently, but will also continue, promises Ms. Shelley. And so, Universal and Carl Laemmle Jr. present her "Bride of Frankenstein"... Lightning strikes twice. This visually stunning motion picture is rightfully regarded as one of the best sequels ever created. They adapted the work exceptionally well - and, most importantly, hired James Whale to return as director. He makes William Hurlbut's screenplay a tapestry of horror weaved with humor. This results in subtext and shadows that continues to breathe new life into an old gem... There is great work from photographer John J. Mescall and art director Charles D. Hall. Franz Waxman's musical score is classic and soundman Gilbert Kurland received an "Oscar" nomination. As their bride, Ms. Lanchester is frightfully ravishing. If there were "Best Supporting Actor" awards in 1935, spectacularly demented mad scientist Ernest Thesiger (as Septimus Pretorius) gives everything you need for some consideration. There are so many levels from which you can enjoy watching, you're guaranteed to enjoy the "Bride of Frankenstein" on one of them. ********** Bride of Frankenstein (4/22/35) James Whale ~ Boris Karloff, Ernest Thesiger, Colin Clive, Elsa Lanchester
