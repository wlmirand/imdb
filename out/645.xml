    I read all the other reviews, some before watching this movie, the rest after. I'm sorry to say that the one titled "What a Nightmare" is the only one that fits my own appreciation for this movie. A movie that could have fulfilled its purpose by being half that long. I understand these people need to belong, no matter how, to some group where they can find companionship and a sort of family feeling, due to the horribly miserable personal lives they have, but to center that need in such a depressing place and with such shallow aims makes me lack all respect for them. Not even ONE of them talks about studying a career or something, something other than that vicious circle of costumes, heavy make up and shallow infantile display of vanity. After all, don't we all want a better situation in life, better neighborhoods, good education, good health, a nice group of friends..., and that goes not only for black people, but for Chinese, Japanese, South Americans, Central and North Americans and the whole world, since we all are human beings with similar needs and dreams. Maybe one is segregated because one places oneself in a segregated position. But these poor souls filled their lives parading every night in childish display, garbed in Halloween costumes and make ups and dreaming of making a splash on Vogue magazine (a close up on the cover better than one inside please) and as the next target to catch a millionaire (white if possible) etc. The yearly Rio de Janeiro Carnival, compared to what we see here, is Heaven on Earth!! The mediocrity of their thoughts, their conversations, their concerns (they seem to live only dreaming of fabulous clothes --impossible for their means-- tons of make up and hair, and to look as beautiful as "those girls on the glossy magazine covers..." (none of them can remotely be called a beauty, not in the wildest dream!!). After a while the movie is so repetitive that one becomes very bored, I mean truly bored!! And depressed... wow, so depressed!!! Aimless, childish lives, black --truly black-- futures (for the ones that make it to continue to live) since the ones murdered were much better off; just imagine them getting old: Infernal, because with their sets of values, living after 22 means The End of Everything). Fortunately for the gay world things have lately taken a turn for the better since this movie was made. Now in the most socially civilized countries there is same sex marriage and adoption, and in some, like here in Argentina, a person can go to a Registry Office without witnesses and change his/her name to the genre they feel it's their own (no medical or surgical intervention needed) and gay tourists can get married within two hours, no questions asked. So, let's hope that gay underworld shown here doesn't exist any longer and people like the ones shown in this movie, nowadays have higher aims for their future (and, better yet, for their PRESENT lives).

    In a film in which the subjects are referred to as having "3 strikes against them" from a socioeconomic, racial, and sexual preference perspective, we as viewers are taken deep into the tight knit community that is New York Ballroom culture. This group of individuals is completely marginalized and essentially shunned by the white patriarchal structure of our society. One of the key aspects and benefits of being a part of a culture of this nature for these individuals is the sense of community that exists as a result. For a group of men who had no one to turn to in their day to day lives, their involvement in the ballroom scene was crucial to their survival as human beings. They were given a place to express themselves and feel comfortable in their own skin (or the skin of others). The way in which the concept of "drag" is explained in the film is not simply a definition consisting of describing gay men who dress in women's clothes. In Paris is Burning, drag is a way to take on a new identity; to disconnect oneself from reality. Chosen costumes and ensembles range from Marilyn Monroe to Marine drill sergeants and anything and everything else imaginable. The transparency with which Jennie Livingston made this film with in terms of her ability to be that ever so crucial fly on the wall, truly gave the subjects their own voice that flowed naturally throughout the film. The hand-held shooting style employed by Livingston made for a genuinely warm and poignant piece. Similar to Shirley Clarke's film Portrait of Jason, the camera and the subjects have very intimate relationships. In both films, ample time is spent focusing on hand motions and body language. By following the model of 90's queer documentary, Livingston contributed to paving the way for other free form documentaries to exist within the culture. Paris is Burning is an ethnological piece that effectively explores a subculture within itself. Ethnographically speaking, Livingston dissects and debunks this marginalized group of individuals "strike" by "strike" throughout the course of the film. We as viewers are able to understand and absorb the fact that these men are people and this is their passion. For people who are unfamiliar with this culture, listening to these men tell their stories and express the importance of the new york ballroom scene in their daily lives, it is quite easy to understand. Paris is Burning paved the way for documentaries focused on marginalized groups of people. In terms of the internet, the majority of the documentaries i come across that are web based (but function in a similar way as Paris is Burning does in terms of purpose and aesthetic) are centered around marginalized groups. Ethnographies are an excellent way to gain an understanding of something or someone that you would not have access to otherwise. Being able to post personal reviews centered around internet based material, leads to the overall further discussion and progression of society and personal relationships with difficult subjects such as race, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation.

    Being a fan of the RuPaul Drag Race show and all the references to Paris Is Burning, a movie I've heard of since high school but never saw until now. Every phrase I thought came from RPDR were actually from this movie 2 decades ago. From shady and fierce to the drag queen art of "reading", this movie seems like the inspiration for RuPaul's show. The film is about the ballroom circuit for the mostly black/latino gay community. The participants walk the ballroom floor in different categories, in a show referred to as "balls". Trophies are given to those who have the most "realness". Some competitions include the now famous "Voguing" - a dance which was popularized by iconic singer Madonna. "Paris Is Burning" seems a bit dated now that being "gay" has gradually been accepted as a natural occurrence, but at the time of filming AIDS and homosexuals were synonymous and gays stigmatized. The titles before each sequence "BALLS", "REALNESS", "HOUSES", etc., were probably the inspiration for Ken Burns' documentaries. "Paris" flows seamlessly depicting the story of how for one night someone can live a fantasy and the struggle to deal back to reality. Filmed in New York City at the end of the 1980's, it's a great insight to an urban community that most of the "straight" world never new existed.

    I came into this knowing very little and came out having watched a fascinating documentary. Made back in 1990, the film follows the majority African American and Latino LGBT communities of New York and the 'ball culture' they attended. I knew nothing of this culture so I found it thoroughly interesting to see inside it. The ball culture consisted of balls hosted by a Queen and King and where contestants 'walk' or compete in different categories. These might be glamour, or decadence or office worker or almost anything. Many of those competing did so for 'Houses' and winning a trophy for your house was something that could make you 'legendary'. Mixing interviews with participants, House leaders and fans, there is a joy in seeing these events take place as despite the overwhelming campness and no doubt hidden bitching, there seems to be a high level of support. It seemed like an amazing night out and for participants an opportunity to express themselves they might not get a chance to do elsewhere. One of the few aspects of the film I did know about was voguing. Madonna made voguing part of popular culture, but the balls are where it first came to prominence as participants would have vogue offs. And the voguing in question is not the Madonna version. This is highly stylized, athletic and fierce and amazing to watch. It is a wonderful insight into a world that you never really here about or indeed see and it would be fascinating to revisit these people and to see whether ball culture exists in the same way today. I loved the end line from drag queen Dorian Corey: 'If you shoot a arrow and it goes real high, hurray for you'. More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com

    Yeah this films is tops. Cant recommend it more. Gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never dull. Great access. A film made with passion and interest in the subject matter. Some of the performances and just amazing. If you only find this film on VHS it is still very worth watching. Great. 10 out of 10. I got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what I was watching. The interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy- weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto. The filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement. Cool. Track it down.

    The film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in. It is well made and very powerful. The persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective. I believe it give great insight into a sub-culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society. It is shocking at times and more powerful because of it. Some parts were difficult to watch, as most reality is, but it is not over done. Its good the first time you watch it, but it becomes even better the second or third time around; because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge.

    Wonderfully put together..I wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost...there should be a part two..a real one. It was great..the film wasn't long enough..I would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up!! this is so important to the community period..well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort...I am really tired of hearing from naive writers how AIDS and Men go together when they don't; actually its the hetero's that we need to look into..this film didn't even bother to mention HIV or AIDS and I was so glad for that..I really appreciated the break downs and definitions too. Thank you s much for allowing this film to exist.

    I had just recently watched "Paris Is Burning" and I love it. I find it very interesting and artistic and creative the way they move and dance. It's like a whole different world. My friend received it as a gift and after watching it I am going to hunt a copy down for my own collection. The next day I found out from a friend that Willie Ninja had just passed away a couple of days before. At first I didn't want to believe him. So I went searching for anything that would confirm what he had said, he was right. Even though I didn't know him personally, there's no doubt in my mind that he will be missed, and I would consider it an honor to have been a friend of his. To anyone who knew him I am sorry.

    First of all I am a butch, straight white male. But even with that handicap I love this movie. It's about real people. A real time and place. And of course New York City in the 80's. I had many gay friends growing up in New York in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them. No matter what the consequences. That's courageous. You have to admire that. This is a great film, watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant African American or Hispanic Gay man in the New York of the eighties. It's real life. Bottom line it's real life.

    Geez, as a Gay man who lives in NYC I can gratefully say that I have never seen the underbelly of Gay Culture that is portrayed in this film - and I am glad of it!!! Was this film broadcast on TV across the United States there would be a great anti-Gay backlash and I cannot say that I would blame them. The people in this film do not represent the average Gay American or even the average Trandgender American, what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare. The inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments (anti-White) are blatant and unsettling - society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the film's "cast" - the actions of these people are not acts of desperation, but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of one's self.

This is a great film, watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant African American or Hispanic Gay man in the New York of the eighties. It's real life. Bottom line it's real life.

    Geez, as a Gay man who lives in NYC I can gratefully say that I have never seen the underbelly of Gay Culture that is portrayed in this film - and I am glad of it!!! Was this film broadcast on TV across the United States there would be a great anti-Gay backlash and I cannot say that I would blame them. The people in this film do not represent the average Gay American or even the average Trandgender American, what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare. The inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments (anti-White) are blatant and unsettling - society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the film's "cast" - the actions of these people are not acts of desperation, but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of one's self.

    I read all the other reviews, some before watching this movie, the rest after. I'm sorry to say that the one titled "What a Nightmare" is the only one that fits my own appreciation for this movie. A movie that could have fulfilled its purpose by being half that long. I understand these people need to belong, no matter how, to some group where they can find companionship and a sort of family feeling, due to the horribly miserable personal lives they have, but to center that need in such a depressing place and with such shallow aims makes me lack all respect for them. Not even ONE of them talks about studying a career or something, something other than that vicious circle of costumes, heavy make up and shallow infantile display of vanity. After all, don't we all want a better situation in life, better neighborhoods, good education, good health, a nice group of friends..., and that goes not only for black people, but for Chinese, Japanese, South Americans, Central and North Americans and the whole world, since we all are human beings with similar needs and dreams. Maybe one is segregated because one places oneself in a segregated position. But these poor souls filled their lives parading every night in childish display, garbed in Halloween costumes and make ups and dreaming of making a splash on Vogue magazine (a close up on the cover better than one inside please) and as the next target to catch a millionaire (white if possible) etc. The yearly Rio de Janeiro Carnival, compared to what we see here, is Heaven on Earth!! The mediocrity of their thoughts, their conversations, their concerns (they seem to live only dreaming of fabulous clothes --impossible for their means-- tons of make up and hair, and to look as beautiful as "those girls on the glossy magazine covers..." (none of them can remotely be called a beauty, not in the wildest dream!!). After a while the movie is so repetitive that one becomes very bored, I mean truly bored!! And depressed... wow, so depressed!!! Aimless, childish lives, black --truly black-- futures (for the ones that make it to continue to live) since the ones murdered were much better off; just imagine them getting old: Infernal, because with their sets of values, living after 22 means The End of Everything). Fortunately for the gay world things have lately taken a turn for the better since this movie was made. Now in the most socially civilized countries there is same sex marriage and adoption, and in some, like here in Argentina, a person can go to a Registry Office without witnesses and change his/her name to the genre they feel it's their own (no medical or surgical intervention needed) and gay tourists can get married within two hours, no questions asked. So, let's hope that gay underworld shown here doesn't exist any longer and people like the ones shown in this movie, nowadays have higher aims for their future (and, better yet, for their PRESENT lives).

    In a film in which the subjects are referred to as having "3 strikes against them" from a socioeconomic, racial, and sexual preference perspective, we as viewers are taken deep into the tight knit community that is New York Ballroom culture. This group of individuals is completely marginalized and essentially shunned by the white patriarchal structure of our society. One of the key aspects and benefits of being a part of a culture of this nature for these individuals is the sense of community that exists as a result. For a group of men who had no one to turn to in their day to day lives, their involvement in the ballroom scene was crucial to their survival as human beings. They were given a place to express themselves and feel comfortable in their own skin (or the skin of others). The way in which the concept of "drag" is explained in the film is not simply a definition consisting of describing gay men who dress in women's clothes. In Paris is Burning, drag is a way to take on a new identity; to disconnect oneself from reality. Chosen costumes and ensembles range from Marilyn Monroe to Marine drill sergeants and anything and everything else imaginable. The transparency with which Jennie Livingston made this film with in terms of her ability to be that ever so crucial fly on the wall, truly gave the subjects their own voice that flowed naturally throughout the film. The hand-held shooting style employed by Livingston made for a genuinely warm and poignant piece. Similar to Shirley Clarke's film Portrait of Jason, the camera and the subjects have very intimate relationships. In both films, ample time is spent focusing on hand motions and body language. By following the model of 90's queer documentary, Livingston contributed to paving the way for other free form documentaries to exist within the culture. Paris is Burning is an ethnological piece that effectively explores a subculture within itself. Ethnographically speaking, Livingston dissects and debunks this marginalized group of individuals "strike" by "strike" throughout the course of the film. We as viewers are able to understand and absorb the fact that these men are people and this is their passion. For people who are unfamiliar with this culture, listening to these men tell their stories and express the importance of the new york ballroom scene in their daily lives, it is quite easy to understand. Paris is Burning paved the way for documentaries focused on marginalized groups of people. In terms of the internet, the majority of the documentaries i come across that are web based (but function in a similar way as Paris is Burning does in terms of purpose and aesthetic) are centered around marginalized groups. Ethnographies are an excellent way to gain an understanding of something or someone that you would not have access to otherwise. Being able to post personal reviews centered around internet based material, leads to the overall further discussion and progression of society and personal relationships with difficult subjects such as race, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation.

    Being a fan of the RuPaul Drag Race show and all the references to Paris Is Burning, a movie I've heard of since high school but never saw until now. Every phrase I thought came from RPDR were actually from this movie 2 decades ago. From shady and fierce to the drag queen art of "reading", this movie seems like the inspiration for RuPaul's show. The film is about the ballroom circuit for the mostly black/latino gay community. The participants walk the ballroom floor in different categories, in a show referred to as "balls". Trophies are given to those who have the most "realness". Some competitions include the now famous "Voguing" - a dance which was popularized by iconic singer Madonna. "Paris Is Burning" seems a bit dated now that being "gay" has gradually been accepted as a natural occurrence, but at the time of filming AIDS and homosexuals were synonymous and gays stigmatized. The titles before each sequence "BALLS", "REALNESS", "HOUSES", etc., were probably the inspiration for Ken Burns' documentaries. "Paris" flows seamlessly depicting the story of how for one night someone can live a fantasy and the struggle to deal back to reality. Filmed in New York City at the end of the 1980's, it's a great insight to an urban community that most of the "straight" world never new existed.

    I came into this knowing very little and came out having watched a fascinating documentary. Made back in 1990, the film follows the majority African American and Latino LGBT communities of New York and the 'ball culture' they attended. I knew nothing of this culture so I found it thoroughly interesting to see inside it. The ball culture consisted of balls hosted by a Queen and King and where contestants 'walk' or compete in different categories. These might be glamour, or decadence or office worker or almost anything. Many of those competing did so for 'Houses' and winning a trophy for your house was something that could make you 'legendary'. Mixing interviews with participants, House leaders and fans, there is a joy in seeing these events take place as despite the overwhelming campness and no doubt hidden bitching, there seems to be a high level of support. It seemed like an amazing night out and for participants an opportunity to express themselves they might not get a chance to do elsewhere. One of the few aspects of the film I did know about was voguing. Madonna made voguing part of popular culture, but the balls are where it first came to prominence as participants would have vogue offs. And the voguing in question is not the Madonna version. This is highly stylized, athletic and fierce and amazing to watch. It is a wonderful insight into a world that you never really here about or indeed see and it would be fascinating to revisit these people and to see whether ball culture exists in the same way today. I loved the end line from drag queen Dorian Corey: 'If you shoot a arrow and it goes real high, hurray for you'. More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com

    Yeah this films is tops. Cant recommend it more. Gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never dull. Great access. A film made with passion and interest in the subject matter. Some of the performances and just amazing. If you only find this film on VHS it is still very worth watching. Great. 10 out of 10. I got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what I was watching. The interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy- weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto. The filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement. Cool. Track it down.

    The film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in. It is well made and very powerful. The persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective. I believe it give great insight into a sub-culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society. It is shocking at times and more powerful because of it. Some parts were difficult to watch, as most reality is, but it is not over done. Its good the first time you watch it, but it becomes even better the second or third time around; because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge.

    Wonderfully put together..I wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost...there should be a part two..a real one. It was great..the film wasn't long enough..I would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up!! this is so important to the community period..well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort...I am really tired of hearing from naive writers how AIDS and Men go together when they don't; actually its the hetero's that we need to look into..this film didn't even bother to mention HIV or AIDS and I was so glad for that..I really appreciated the break downs and definitions too. Thank you s much for allowing this film to exist.

    I had just recently watched "Paris Is Burning" and I love it. I find it very interesting and artistic and creative the way they move and dance. It's like a whole different world. My friend received it as a gift and after watching it I am going to hunt a copy down for my own collection. The next day I found out from a friend that Willie Ninja had just passed away a couple of days before. At first I didn't want to believe him. So I went searching for anything that would confirm what he had said, he was right. Even though I didn't know him personally, there's no doubt in my mind that he will be missed, and I would consider it an honor to have been a friend of his. To anyone who knew him I am sorry.

    First of all I am a butch, straight white male. But even with that handicap I love this movie. It's about real people. A real time and place. And of course New York City in the 80's. I had many gay friends growing up in New York in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them. No matter what the consequences. That's courageous. You have to admire that. This is a great film, watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant African American or Hispanic Gay man in the New York of the eighties. It's real life. Bottom line it's real life.
