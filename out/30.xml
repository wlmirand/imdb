    Here is the fascinating depiction of a woman so badly damaged by incest that she can't relate to her loving husband and spends most of her time in a world of fantasy, where she is tortured and raped. Catherine Deneuve dazzles as the picture-perfect, emotionally detached housewife suffering aftereffects of abuse by her father. One day she takes her self-flagellation from the realm of the mind to the chambers of a bordello, where it's unattractive johns who slap her around and make her bleed. As if that weren't punishment enough, Belle takes a freelance job in which she lies in a coffin to play the dead daughter of an obsessive incest perpetrator -- "I hope you can forgive me, but I loved you so" -- who masturbates below her scantily clad body. Severine/Belle de Jour admits she doesn't understand why she engages in actions that humiliate and harm her. Her blind acting out eventually claims the life of her greatest supporter -- and at that point it's Severine who has become an abuser herself. The only way she can tolerate this realization is to withdraw once again into the world of make-believe. And now Severine's fantasy is a joyous one. She has healed but is lost to the world. This is an incredibly grim and pessimistic film. When I first saw "Belle" years ago, I could make little sense of it. At last, I think I understand.

    Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, probably the king of surrealist films, opens Belle de Jour, his first color film, with a couple of lingering shots and minimal sound which makes me feel like I was thrown in a different world or staring at beautiful paintings - which rightly sets the mood for 100 minutes of pure surreal movie experience. On the film's technical aspects, there is no background music except for the all-important bird/bell sounds; and the cinematography & lighting are not as visually satisfying as other films i've seen. It's probably intentional on Bu&ntilde;uel's part, I wouldn't know.. but it doesn't affect the quality of the film at all. The smooth/uninterrupted editing, I think is nicely done because the transition between Belle's fantasies & realities looks seamless which adds to the film's puzzling "which is which" reality. But the "fantasy" scenes, in my opinion, are just excellent in its simplicity, not too much garish artsy fartsy touch, but enough technical creativeness to give the audience a pure surreal treat. Not a bad choice for a Bu&ntilde;uel virgin. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing his masterful manipulation of his surrealist techniques and his tasteful execution of "sexual depravities" without having to resort to showing any nudity or crass sex scenes. At the end of the film, it's interesting to note that in a way, this is like a mix of Inception, The Housemaid, and Mulholland Drive, but satisfyingly less complicated. It doesn't mean that it won't leave you scratching your head, as Bu&ntilde;uel decides to keep this film open to your own interpretations. Catherine Deneuve IS Belle de Jour. I just love her in this one.

    As any emotion or idea is teased out in art cinema, Belle De Jour brings forth understanding of the complex notion of humanity's most damning conundrum: we want most what we cannot have. As love may be the most powerful of our emotions, not even it can save lovely Sevinne from self- destructing her perfect life. Many films explore the idea love deprivation and its effects, but this is the first I have seen which explores what happens when we actually get what we want. The seeming madness which ensues is meaningful because it makes sense; the progression is strangely not just plausible, but logical. A beautifully photographed piece of visual as well as narrative art, Belle De Jour is subtle in its themes, deterministic and yet random in its story. In other words, it is real....it leaves one with a haunting understanding of the true nature of the human animal.

    Catherine Deneuve puts on a masterful performance as a frigid housewife named "Severine Serizy" who loves her husband "Pierre Serizy" (Jean Sorel) very much but cannot satisfy him sexually because she was sexually abused in her childhood. Or at least, that is what the viewers are led to believe because she has fantasies and dreams which seem to take on a life of their own and one is never sure where the line is drawn at times. Be that as it may, while she apparently cannot have sexual relations with her husband, she still has needs and she becomes a prostitute to fulfill them. At first she is very scared and tentative, but as she continues to work she gains more experience and becomes more confident and relaxed. Unfortunately, complications arise and things begin to get out of control. Now, rather than divulging how the story ends, I will just say that it is open to interpretation and let the viewer decide for himself. Additionally, while the subject and some of the scenes are somewhat risqu&eacute;, there isn't a great deal of nudity or sex actually in this film. That said, depending on your point of view, that could be good or it could be bad. Regardless, I personally think Catherine Deneuve is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever grace the screen and I was delighted by her performance all the same.

    Amazingly good and surviving the necessary test of aging. Now I understand who Catherine Deneuve really is as an actress. She's simply great as Severine/Belle de Jour, and Bu&ntilde;uel is a genius. I thought it was impossible for me to watch this sixties' experiment, filmed the same year I was born, coincidentally. I read the book first back in the seventies, when I was maybe eight, nine years old, and I can't just begin to explain to you, oh good people, how reading that book had a certain effect on my erotic perception of the world in those faraway, bygone days, and I'm simply talking about my early and intense wanking pubescence activity. This film is so true to the original story and so well acted it hurts. The surrealistic management of time and places are all but a simple exercise in Belle de Jour, and that's when you understand what it means to be open-minded while you're watching a real piece of Seventh Art. Do not hesitate in watching and re-watching this movie, a production made back when art really meant something to film directors and to the public. Controversial as it is Nabokov/Kubric's Lolita, Belle de Jour contains some very un-PC scenes involving kids which would be banned, had they been filmed nowadays, because back in those days Political Correctness simply meant nothing and wasn't an impediment at all to the making of filmed art. I highly praise the moment I took away prejudices from my mind and decided to watch this movie for the first time after all these years. I was beautifully surprised and just couldn't stop watching till the end. And talking about the ending...., it has that special seal you know, like when you turn to see if someone else, someone maybe sitting beside you and who may or may not explain to you what the director really meant, you not being convinced at all by the happy ending it seems to portray the first time you watch it. And this comment may contain a spoiler, but Severine/Belle de Jour is so nuts she takes you away with her craziness until the very end, making you to want to believe there's a happy ending and not just another one of the mind- tricks she performs in order to introduce some balance into her strange, unreal reality. This film is, by all means, a real 10-star one, and one that shouldn't let you undisturbed. Thumbs up for the French avant-garde represented in this movie, not one of Bu&ntilde;uel's "little movies", as some pretend it is, but a postmodern classic in psychological drama. It has that dirty, corrupt air you get a taste of when dealing with songs like "Lemon incest", as recorded by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western/Mafia/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western/Mafia/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again: a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.

    After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour', I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel was trying to say. And if you asked Bu&ntilde;uel what the meaning of the film was, he probably would have told you 'it is, what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour', Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative. Bu&ntilde;uel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments, an idyllic carriage-ride (seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel) morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Bu&ntilde;uel's protagonist, S&eacute;verine (Catherine Deneuve) is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband, Pierre. But in a blink of an eye, Bu&ntilde;uel has the last laugh (or should I say the first laugh?) when we see that the assault on S&eacute;verine is a figment of her imagination. In reality, she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967. But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation, Bu&ntilde;uel is committed to shocking us again. S&eacute;verine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as S&eacute;verine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result, they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations. In reality, nothing is normal for S&eacute;verine--she must endure Husson, the boyfriend of the couple's friend, Ren&eacute;e, who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a high-class whorehouse. This is how S&eacute;verine finds out about Madame Ana&iuml;s' establishment, which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at, as a high-class call girl. While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child, Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in contrasting S&eacute;verine's life as an unhappy, chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Bu&ntilde;uel takes great pleasure in emphasizing S&eacute;verine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). S&eacute;verine also expresses disgust to Madame Ana&iuml;s. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies. Bu&ntilde;uel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who S&eacute;verine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with S&eacute;verine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive. Bu&ntilde;uel comes full circle playing with his audience. If S&eacute;verine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that S&eacute;verine refers to Pierre's "accident" as he sits in his wheelchair. An "accident" seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an "accident" (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of S&eacute;verine's imagination. The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and S&eacute;verine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Bu&ntilde;uel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now S&eacute;verine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on S&eacute;verine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death. For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.

    Spanish-born Mexican screenwriter, producer, film editor and director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's twenty-fourth feature film which he co-wrote with French actor and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, is an adaptation of a novel from 1928 by French author and journalist Joseph Kessel. It was screened In competition at the 28th Venice International Film Festival in 1967, was shot on locations in Paris, France and is a French-Italy co-production which was produced by Egyptian brothers and producers Robert Hakim (1907-1992) and Raymond Hakim (1909-1980). It tells the story about S&eacute;verine Serizy, a insatiable, distant and noticeably attractive woman who lives in a dispirited marriage with her surgeon husband Pierre Serizy, who is very displeased with his young wife whom he finds cold and unkind. S&eacute;verine's life is restrained by her poor marriage and she only finds pleasure in her vivid fantasies, but her life changes significantly when she takes a day-job at a high-class brothel in Paris, France and meets a gangster named Marcel who seems to possess everything she is looking for and more. Distinctly and precisely directed by surrealist filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (1900-1983), this luminous and intricate fictional tale which is narrated from the protagonist's point of view, draws a singular portrayal of a complex femme fatale's strange experiences at a French house of prostitution and her fantasy-driven relationship with a wicked young man whilst leading a double life. While notable for it's diverse and atmospheric milieu depictions, stellar cinematography by French cinematographer Sacha Vierny (1919-2001), production design by French production designer Robert Clavel (1912-1999), costume design by costume designer H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Nourry, fine editing by film editor Louisette Hautecoeur and use of sound, this character-driven and dialog-driven psychological comedy-drama from the late 1960s where reality and dreams are entwined, depicts an intriguing and in-depth study of character about self-realization. This rhythmic, surreal, humorous, amoral and discreetly erotic story about a bourgeoisie housewife who has become so imprisoned by her unfulfilled desires that she has withdrawn herself into an imaginary internal world, is impelled and reinforced by it's colorful characters, substantial character development, fragmented narrative structure, the incomparable and unforgettable acting performance by French actress Catherine Deneauve in one of her most renowned roles and the fine supporting acting performances by French actor Pierre Cl&eacute;menti (1942-1999), French actress Gen&egrave;vieve Page and French actor Jean Sorel. A mysterious, picturesque and versatile modernist melodrama which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion at the 28th Venice Film Festival in 1967.

    Its story makes that this movie isn't anything usual to watch. But really, that should come as no surprise, since the movie got directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. A man who loved to create some surrealistic pictures, about unusual subjects. But as far as Luis Bu&ntilde;uel movie go, this one is pretty mainstream and straightforward. It still has some dreamlike sequences in it but overall its narrative, dialog and characters are easy to follow and understand, making this movie a perfectly accessible one for just about everybody. So really, don't let the name Luis Bu&ntilde;uel scare you off, if you are afraid for some artsy fartsy type of stuff. Really hardly any of that present in this movie, though it still remains something unique and stylish to watch. The movie and its story is being an exploration of a woman's sexual fantasies. And it's not the romantic and cute kind of stuff. Things like bondage and other masochism pass through this movie, which all seems to be in big contrast with the cute looking and soft spoken Catherine Deneuve character. But that also makes it work out, I guess. It keeps things surprising and interesting because you basically never know what you can expect next from her and where the movie will be going with everything. Despite of its serious and heavy sounding subject, this actually remains a pretty fun movie to watch as well. This is all due to the unusual fantasies and the wishes of the customers the Catherine Deneuve character hooks up with, when she starts working as a part-time prostitute. The movie handles all of its themes very well and interesting, which gets you into the mind of the main character and understand her dilemmas and motivations. You don't ever condemn her, even though she is also committing adultery on her unknowing and somewhat too sweet and naive husband. It all got beautiful told and shot, thanks to Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's directing approach, which had always been more visually orientated. A great and original movie to watch! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    A hypnotic blend of fantasy and reality, Belle De Jour is the first film I've seen from Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and it certainly won't be the last. The opening scene is a memorable one, as Severine and Pierre Serizy (Catherine Deneuve and Jean Sorel) ride in a carriage through the woods, before he drags her out, ties her to a tree and has the drivers whip and rape her. This shocking image turns out to be just a fantasy of Severine's, but it immediately lets the viewer know that there is a caged erotic mind locked away underneath the titular character's frigid exterior. The film uses these fantasies frequently, and it's in Bu&ntilde;uel's approach to them that the film sets itself apart from the way others might use this meshing of truth and fiction. We are never given any warning signs that we are entering a dream state, there's never a blur or fade into them, he doesn't shoot them in a way unique from how he shoots her daily life, and thus Bu&ntilde;uel catches the audience in this world between worlds. Deneuve, ever alluring and catching of the eyes, walks through her life as a woman in a trance, stuck between her lurid fantasies and her more traditional reality, and Bu&ntilde;uel places the audience in this same spell. Severine is a mysterious character, one who dreams of being sexually humiliated and violated, yet for some reason she remains sterile within her own marriage, despite her husband's numerous efforts. Severine finds herself compelled by her sexual desires to enter employment at a local whorehouse, and in this world she is able to slowly reveal her inner nature. Belle De Jour is a character study in the most interesting sense, because it never aims to fully explore it's character. We are given the understanding of why she travels down the path she does, but the character ultimately remains an ambiguous mystery, both to the audience and perhaps to herself. It's plausible that even she doesn't know why she can't open herself physically to her husband, and her actions to explore her inner desires are a way not only for her to release her sexual frustration but also to try and understand what drives her. This approach to the character could have been cold and uninviting, shutting it's audience away from any level of interest, but with a team as skilled as Bu&ntilde;uel and Deneuve it becomes a fascinating journey into the mind of Severine, always compelling in it's refusal to give the audience the easy answers. The narrative takes a more direct turn with the introduction of Marcel (Pierre Clementi), a client for Severine who becomes dangerously obsessed with her and is the complete counter of Pierre. The introduction of Marcel was both a blessing and a curse for me, because while it advanced the narrative and Severine's personal struggles, I found myself so entertained by him and his partner in crime Hyppolite (Francisco Rabal) that I wanted to see a film entirely dedicated to the two of them. Bu&ntilde;uel's Belle De Jour plays out like a dream state all the way to it's chilling finale, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

    First seeing Luis Bunuel's film here, there are a few surreal aspects to it, but the premise really is a young attractive wife of a doctor, who lives in Paris but is bored with her existence and has intimacy issues with her husband. It is very odd at first as we see her visiting with her husband Pierre's friends, at parties, etc...but really her mind is elsewhere, she wants a form of appreciation, obsession, perhaps lust or love. A woman is never quite sure, but knows when her husband is emotionally neglectful. She wanders the boutique shops of Paris, eventually wandering to Madame Anais' (Genevieve Page) brothel which is a small non-described building in the middle of the city. Initially, she is just curious and wanders in, asking about employment. Deneuve as Severine is beautiful here, her pale blonde hair, demure, and sensual. After awhile she is intrigued and Madame Anais makes up her alias "belle du jour", she works during the day, and encounters some very odd characters. One is an Asian businessman with a propensity for masochism, up to a motorcycle man with metal teeth, very strange. There are some interesting visuals with horse and carriage, bells, and a man with a death fetish. The visuals have to be seen to be appreciated. Basically addresses psychology of women, in a sense, and the sometime need for escapism in marriage. Recommended.

Or at least, that is what the viewers are led to believe because she has fantasies and dreams which seem to take on a life of their own and one is never sure where the line is drawn at times. Be that as it may, while she apparently cannot have sexual relations with her husband, she still has needs and she becomes a prostitute to fulfill them. At first she is very scared and tentative, but as she continues to work she gains more experience and becomes more confident and relaxed. Unfortunately, complications arise and things begin to get out of control. Now, rather than divulging how the story ends, I will just say that it is open to interpretation and let the viewer decide for himself. Additionally, while the subject and some of the scenes are somewhat risqu&eacute;, there isn't a great deal of nudity or sex actually in this film. That said, depending on your point of view, that could be good or it could be bad. Regardless, I personally think Catherine Deneuve is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever grace the screen and I was delighted by her performance all the same.

    Amazingly good and surviving the necessary test of aging. Now I understand who Catherine Deneuve really is as an actress. She's simply great as Severine/Belle de Jour, and Bu&ntilde;uel is a genius. I thought it was impossible for me to watch this sixties' experiment, filmed the same year I was born, coincidentally. I read the book first back in the seventies, when I was maybe eight, nine years old, and I can't just begin to explain to you, oh good people, how reading that book had a certain effect on my erotic perception of the world in those faraway, bygone days, and I'm simply talking about my early and intense wanking pubescence activity. This film is so true to the original story and so well acted it hurts. The surrealistic management of time and places are all but a simple exercise in Belle de Jour, and that's when you understand what it means to be open-minded while you're watching a real piece of Seventh Art. Do not hesitate in watching and re-watching this movie, a production made back when art really meant something to film directors and to the public. Controversial as it is Nabokov/Kubric's Lolita, Belle de Jour contains some very un-PC scenes involving kids which would be banned, had they been filmed nowadays, because back in those days Political Correctness simply meant nothing and wasn't an impediment at all to the making of filmed art. I highly praise the moment I took away prejudices from my mind and decided to watch this movie for the first time after all these years. I was beautifully surprised and just couldn't stop watching till the end. And talking about the ending...., it has that special seal you know, like when you turn to see if someone else, someone maybe sitting beside you and who may or may not explain to you what the director really meant, you not being convinced at all by the happy ending it seems to portray the first time you watch it. And this comment may contain a spoiler, but Severine/Belle de Jour is so nuts she takes you away with her craziness until the very end, making you to want to believe there's a happy ending and not just another one of the mind- tricks she performs in order to introduce some balance into her strange, unreal reality. This film is, by all means, a real 10-star one, and one that shouldn't let you undisturbed. Thumbs up for the French avant-garde represented in this movie, not one of Bu&ntilde;uel's "little movies", as some pretend it is, but a postmodern classic in psychological drama. It has that dirty, corrupt air you get a taste of when dealing with songs like "Lemon incest", as recorded by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western/Mafia/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western/Mafia/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again: a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.

    After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour', I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel was trying to say. And if you asked Bu&ntilde;uel what the meaning of the film was, he probably would have told you 'it is, what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour', Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative. Bu&ntilde;uel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments, an idyllic carriage-ride (seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel) morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Bu&ntilde;uel's protagonist, S&eacute;verine (Catherine Deneuve) is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband, Pierre. But in a blink of an eye, Bu&ntilde;uel has the last laugh (or should I say the first laugh?) when we see that the assault on S&eacute;verine is a figment of her imagination. In reality, she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967. But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation, Bu&ntilde;uel is committed to shocking us again. S&eacute;verine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as S&eacute;verine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result, they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations. In reality, nothing is normal for S&eacute;verine--she must endure Husson, the boyfriend of the couple's friend, Ren&eacute;e, who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a high-class whorehouse. This is how S&eacute;verine finds out about Madame Ana&iuml;s' establishment, which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at, as a high-class call girl. While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child, Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in contrasting S&eacute;verine's life as an unhappy, chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Bu&ntilde;uel takes great pleasure in emphasizing S&eacute;verine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). S&eacute;verine also expresses disgust to Madame Ana&iuml;s. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies. Bu&ntilde;uel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who S&eacute;verine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with S&eacute;verine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive. Bu&ntilde;uel comes full circle playing with his audience. If S&eacute;verine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that S&eacute;verine refers to Pierre's "accident" as he sits in his wheelchair. An "accident" seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an "accident" (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of S&eacute;verine's imagination. The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and S&eacute;verine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Bu&ntilde;uel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now S&eacute;verine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on S&eacute;verine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death. For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.

    Spanish-born Mexican screenwriter, producer, film editor and director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's twenty-fourth feature film which he co-wrote with French actor and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, is an adaptation of a novel from 1928 by French author and journalist Joseph Kessel. It was screened In competition at the 28th Venice International Film Festival in 1967, was shot on locations in Paris, France and is a French-Italy co-production which was produced by Egyptian brothers and producers Robert Hakim (1907-1992) and Raymond Hakim (1909-1980). It tells the story about S&eacute;verine Serizy, a insatiable, distant and noticeably attractive woman who lives in a dispirited marriage with her surgeon husband Pierre Serizy, who is very displeased with his young wife whom he finds cold and unkind. S&eacute;verine's life is restrained by her poor marriage and she only finds pleasure in her vivid fantasies, but her life changes significantly when she takes a day-job at a high-class brothel in Paris, France and meets a gangster named Marcel who seems to possess everything she is looking for and more. Distinctly and precisely directed by surrealist filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (1900-1983), this luminous and intricate fictional tale which is narrated from the protagonist's point of view, draws a singular portrayal of a complex femme fatale's strange experiences at a French house of prostitution and her fantasy-driven relationship with a wicked young man whilst leading a double life. While notable for it's diverse and atmospheric milieu depictions, stellar cinematography by French cinematographer Sacha Vierny (1919-2001), production design by French production designer Robert Clavel (1912-1999), costume design by costume designer H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Nourry, fine editing by film editor Louisette Hautecoeur and use of sound, this character-driven and dialog-driven psychological comedy-drama from the late 1960s where reality and dreams are entwined, depicts an intriguing and in-depth study of character about self-realization. This rhythmic, surreal, humorous, amoral and discreetly erotic story about a bourgeoisie housewife who has become so imprisoned by her unfulfilled desires that she has withdrawn herself into an imaginary internal world, is impelled and reinforced by it's colorful characters, substantial character development, fragmented narrative structure, the incomparable and unforgettable acting performance by French actress Catherine Deneauve in one of her most renowned roles and the fine supporting acting performances by French actor Pierre Cl&eacute;menti (1942-1999), French actress Gen&egrave;vieve Page and French actor Jean Sorel. A mysterious, picturesque and versatile modernist melodrama which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion at the 28th Venice Film Festival in 1967.

    Its story makes that this movie isn't anything usual to watch. But really, that should come as no surprise, since the movie got directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. A man who loved to create some surrealistic pictures, about unusual subjects. But as far as Luis Bu&ntilde;uel movie go, this one is pretty mainstream and straightforward. It still has some dreamlike sequences in it but overall its narrative, dialog and characters are easy to follow and understand, making this movie a perfectly accessible one for just about everybody. So really, don't let the name Luis Bu&ntilde;uel scare you off, if you are afraid for some artsy fartsy type of stuff. Really hardly any of that present in this movie, though it still remains something unique and stylish to watch. The movie and its story is being an exploration of a woman's sexual fantasies. And it's not the romantic and cute kind of stuff. Things like bondage and other masochism pass through this movie, which all seems to be in big contrast with the cute looking and soft spoken Catherine Deneuve character. But that also makes it work out, I guess. It keeps things surprising and interesting because you basically never know what you can expect next from her and where the movie will be going with everything. Despite of its serious and heavy sounding subject, this actually remains a pretty fun movie to watch as well. This is all due to the unusual fantasies and the wishes of the customers the Catherine Deneuve character hooks up with, when she starts working as a part-time prostitute. The movie handles all of its themes very well and interesting, which gets you into the mind of the main character and understand her dilemmas and motivations. You don't ever condemn her, even though she is also committing adultery on her unknowing and somewhat too sweet and naive husband. It all got beautiful told and shot, thanks to Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's directing approach, which had always been more visually orientated. A great and original movie to watch! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    A hypnotic blend of fantasy and reality, Belle De Jour is the first film I've seen from Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and it certainly won't be the last. The opening scene is a memorable one, as Severine and Pierre Serizy (Catherine Deneuve and Jean Sorel) ride in a carriage through the woods, before he drags her out, ties her to a tree and has the drivers whip and rape her. This shocking image turns out to be just a fantasy of Severine's, but it immediately lets the viewer know that there is a caged erotic mind locked away underneath the titular character's frigid exterior. The film uses these fantasies frequently, and it's in Bu&ntilde;uel's approach to them that the film sets itself apart from the way others might use this meshing of truth and fiction. We are never given any warning signs that we are entering a dream state, there's never a blur or fade into them, he doesn't shoot them in a way unique from how he shoots her daily life, and thus Bu&ntilde;uel catches the audience in this world between worlds. Deneuve, ever alluring and catching of the eyes, walks through her life as a woman in a trance, stuck between her lurid fantasies and her more traditional reality, and Bu&ntilde;uel places the audience in this same spell. Severine is a mysterious character, one who dreams of being sexually humiliated and violated, yet for some reason she remains sterile within her own marriage, despite her husband's numerous efforts. Severine finds herself compelled by her sexual desires to enter employment at a local whorehouse, and in this world she is able to slowly reveal her inner nature. Belle De Jour is a character study in the most interesting sense, because it never aims to fully explore it's character. We are given the understanding of why she travels down the path she does, but the character ultimately remains an ambiguous mystery, both to the audience and perhaps to herself. It's plausible that even she doesn't know why she can't open herself physically to her husband, and her actions to explore her inner desires are a way not only for her to release her sexual frustration but also to try and understand what drives her. This approach to the character could have been cold and uninviting, shutting it's audience away from any level of interest, but with a team as skilled as Bu&ntilde;uel and Deneuve it becomes a fascinating journey into the mind of Severine, always compelling in it's refusal to give the audience the easy answers. The narrative takes a more direct turn with the introduction of Marcel (Pierre Clementi), a client for Severine who becomes dangerously obsessed with her and is the complete counter of Pierre. The introduction of Marcel was both a blessing and a curse for me, because while it advanced the narrative and Severine's personal struggles, I found myself so entertained by him and his partner in crime Hyppolite (Francisco Rabal) that I wanted to see a film entirely dedicated to the two of them. Bu&ntilde;uel's Belle De Jour plays out like a dream state all the way to it's chilling finale, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

    First seeing Luis Bunuel's film here, there are a few surreal aspects to it, but the premise really is a young attractive wife of a doctor, who lives in Paris but is bored with her existence and has intimacy issues with her husband. It is very odd at first as we see her visiting with her husband Pierre's friends, at parties, etc...but really her mind is elsewhere, she wants a form of appreciation, obsession, perhaps lust or love. A woman is never quite sure, but knows when her husband is emotionally neglectful. She wanders the boutique shops of Paris, eventually wandering to Madame Anais' (Genevieve Page) brothel which is a small non-described building in the middle of the city. Initially, she is just curious and wanders in, asking about employment. Deneuve as Severine is beautiful here, her pale blonde hair, demure, and sensual. After awhile she is intrigued and Madame Anais makes up her alias "belle du jour", she works during the day, and encounters some very odd characters. One is an Asian businessman with a propensity for masochism, up to a motorcycle man with metal teeth, very strange. There are some interesting visuals with horse and carriage, bells, and a man with a death fetish. The visuals have to be seen to be appreciated. Basically addresses psychology of women, in a sense, and the sometime need for escapism in marriage. Recommended.

    Here is the fascinating depiction of a woman so badly damaged by incest that she can't relate to her loving husband and spends most of her time in a world of fantasy, where she is tortured and raped. Catherine Deneuve dazzles as the picture-perfect, emotionally detached housewife suffering aftereffects of abuse by her father. One day she takes her self-flagellation from the realm of the mind to the chambers of a bordello, where it's unattractive johns who slap her around and make her bleed. As if that weren't punishment enough, Belle takes a freelance job in which she lies in a coffin to play the dead daughter of an obsessive incest perpetrator -- "I hope you can forgive me, but I loved you so" -- who masturbates below her scantily clad body. Severine/Belle de Jour admits she doesn't understand why she engages in actions that humiliate and harm her. Her blind acting out eventually claims the life of her greatest supporter -- and at that point it's Severine who has become an abuser herself. The only way she can tolerate this realization is to withdraw once again into the world of make-believe. And now Severine's fantasy is a joyous one. She has healed but is lost to the world. This is an incredibly grim and pessimistic film. When I first saw "Belle" years ago, I could make little sense of it. At last, I think I understand.

    Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, probably the king of surrealist films, opens Belle de Jour, his first color film, with a couple of lingering shots and minimal sound which makes me feel like I was thrown in a different world or staring at beautiful paintings - which rightly sets the mood for 100 minutes of pure surreal movie experience. On the film's technical aspects, there is no background music except for the all-important bird/bell sounds; and the cinematography & lighting are not as visually satisfying as other films i've seen. It's probably intentional on Bu&ntilde;uel's part, I wouldn't know.. but it doesn't affect the quality of the film at all. The smooth/uninterrupted editing, I think is nicely done because the transition between Belle's fantasies & realities looks seamless which adds to the film's puzzling "which is which" reality. But the "fantasy" scenes, in my opinion, are just excellent in its simplicity, not too much garish artsy fartsy touch, but enough technical creativeness to give the audience a pure surreal treat. Not a bad choice for a Bu&ntilde;uel virgin. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing his masterful manipulation of his surrealist techniques and his tasteful execution of "sexual depravities" without having to resort to showing any nudity or crass sex scenes. At the end of the film, it's interesting to note that in a way, this is like a mix of Inception, The Housemaid, and Mulholland Drive, but satisfyingly less complicated. It doesn't mean that it won't leave you scratching your head, as Bu&ntilde;uel decides to keep this film open to your own interpretations. Catherine Deneuve IS Belle de Jour. I just love her in this one.

    As any emotion or idea is teased out in art cinema, Belle De Jour brings forth understanding of the complex notion of humanity's most damning conundrum: we want most what we cannot have. As love may be the most powerful of our emotions, not even it can save lovely Sevinne from self- destructing her perfect life. Many films explore the idea love deprivation and its effects, but this is the first I have seen which explores what happens when we actually get what we want. The seeming madness which ensues is meaningful because it makes sense; the progression is strangely not just plausible, but logical. A beautifully photographed piece of visual as well as narrative art, Belle De Jour is subtle in its themes, deterministic and yet random in its story. In other words, it is real....it leaves one with a haunting understanding of the true nature of the human animal.

The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). S&eacute;verine also expresses disgust to Madame Ana&iuml;s. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies. Bu&ntilde;uel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who S&eacute;verine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with S&eacute;verine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive. Bu&ntilde;uel comes full circle playing with his audience. If S&eacute;verine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that S&eacute;verine refers to Pierre's "accident" as he sits in his wheelchair. An "accident" seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an "accident" (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of S&eacute;verine's imagination. The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and S&eacute;verine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Bu&ntilde;uel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now S&eacute;verine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on S&eacute;verine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death. For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.

    Spanish-born Mexican screenwriter, producer, film editor and director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's twenty-fourth feature film which he co-wrote with French actor and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, is an adaptation of a novel from 1928 by French author and journalist Joseph Kessel. It was screened In competition at the 28th Venice International Film Festival in 1967, was shot on locations in Paris, France and is a French-Italy co-production which was produced by Egyptian brothers and producers Robert Hakim (1907-1992) and Raymond Hakim (1909-1980). It tells the story about S&eacute;verine Serizy, a insatiable, distant and noticeably attractive woman who lives in a dispirited marriage with her surgeon husband Pierre Serizy, who is very displeased with his young wife whom he finds cold and unkind. S&eacute;verine's life is restrained by her poor marriage and she only finds pleasure in her vivid fantasies, but her life changes significantly when she takes a day-job at a high-class brothel in Paris, France and meets a gangster named Marcel who seems to possess everything she is looking for and more. Distinctly and precisely directed by surrealist filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (1900-1983), this luminous and intricate fictional tale which is narrated from the protagonist's point of view, draws a singular portrayal of a complex femme fatale's strange experiences at a French house of prostitution and her fantasy-driven relationship with a wicked young man whilst leading a double life. While notable for it's diverse and atmospheric milieu depictions, stellar cinematography by French cinematographer Sacha Vierny (1919-2001), production design by French production designer Robert Clavel (1912-1999), costume design by costume designer H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Nourry, fine editing by film editor Louisette Hautecoeur and use of sound, this character-driven and dialog-driven psychological comedy-drama from the late 1960s where reality and dreams are entwined, depicts an intriguing and in-depth study of character about self-realization. This rhythmic, surreal, humorous, amoral and discreetly erotic story about a bourgeoisie housewife who has become so imprisoned by her unfulfilled desires that she has withdrawn herself into an imaginary internal world, is impelled and reinforced by it's colorful characters, substantial character development, fragmented narrative structure, the incomparable and unforgettable acting performance by French actress Catherine Deneauve in one of her most renowned roles and the fine supporting acting performances by French actor Pierre Cl&eacute;menti (1942-1999), French actress Gen&egrave;vieve Page and French actor Jean Sorel. A mysterious, picturesque and versatile modernist melodrama which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion at the 28th Venice Film Festival in 1967.

    Its story makes that this movie isn't anything usual to watch. But really, that should come as no surprise, since the movie got directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. A man who loved to create some surrealistic pictures, about unusual subjects. But as far as Luis Bu&ntilde;uel movie go, this one is pretty mainstream and straightforward. It still has some dreamlike sequences in it but overall its narrative, dialog and characters are easy to follow and understand, making this movie a perfectly accessible one for just about everybody. So really, don't let the name Luis Bu&ntilde;uel scare you off, if you are afraid for some artsy fartsy type of stuff. Really hardly any of that present in this movie, though it still remains something unique and stylish to watch. The movie and its story is being an exploration of a woman's sexual fantasies. And it's not the romantic and cute kind of stuff. Things like bondage and other masochism pass through this movie, which all seems to be in big contrast with the cute looking and soft spoken Catherine Deneuve character. But that also makes it work out, I guess. It keeps things surprising and interesting because you basically never know what you can expect next from her and where the movie will be going with everything. Despite of its serious and heavy sounding subject, this actually remains a pretty fun movie to watch as well. This is all due to the unusual fantasies and the wishes of the customers the Catherine Deneuve character hooks up with, when she starts working as a part-time prostitute. The movie handles all of its themes very well and interesting, which gets you into the mind of the main character and understand her dilemmas and motivations. You don't ever condemn her, even though she is also committing adultery on her unknowing and somewhat too sweet and naive husband. It all got beautiful told and shot, thanks to Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's directing approach, which had always been more visually orientated. A great and original movie to watch! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    A hypnotic blend of fantasy and reality, Belle De Jour is the first film I've seen from Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and it certainly won't be the last. The opening scene is a memorable one, as Severine and Pierre Serizy (Catherine Deneuve and Jean Sorel) ride in a carriage through the woods, before he drags her out, ties her to a tree and has the drivers whip and rape her. This shocking image turns out to be just a fantasy of Severine's, but it immediately lets the viewer know that there is a caged erotic mind locked away underneath the titular character's frigid exterior. The film uses these fantasies frequently, and it's in Bu&ntilde;uel's approach to them that the film sets itself apart from the way others might use this meshing of truth and fiction. We are never given any warning signs that we are entering a dream state, there's never a blur or fade into them, he doesn't shoot them in a way unique from how he shoots her daily life, and thus Bu&ntilde;uel catches the audience in this world between worlds. Deneuve, ever alluring and catching of the eyes, walks through her life as a woman in a trance, stuck between her lurid fantasies and her more traditional reality, and Bu&ntilde;uel places the audience in this same spell. Severine is a mysterious character, one who dreams of being sexually humiliated and violated, yet for some reason she remains sterile within her own marriage, despite her husband's numerous efforts. Severine finds herself compelled by her sexual desires to enter employment at a local whorehouse, and in this world she is able to slowly reveal her inner nature. Belle De Jour is a character study in the most interesting sense, because it never aims to fully explore it's character. We are given the understanding of why she travels down the path she does, but the character ultimately remains an ambiguous mystery, both to the audience and perhaps to herself. It's plausible that even she doesn't know why she can't open herself physically to her husband, and her actions to explore her inner desires are a way not only for her to release her sexual frustration but also to try and understand what drives her. This approach to the character could have been cold and uninviting, shutting it's audience away from any level of interest, but with a team as skilled as Bu&ntilde;uel and Deneuve it becomes a fascinating journey into the mind of Severine, always compelling in it's refusal to give the audience the easy answers. The narrative takes a more direct turn with the introduction of Marcel (Pierre Clementi), a client for Severine who becomes dangerously obsessed with her and is the complete counter of Pierre. The introduction of Marcel was both a blessing and a curse for me, because while it advanced the narrative and Severine's personal struggles, I found myself so entertained by him and his partner in crime Hyppolite (Francisco Rabal) that I wanted to see a film entirely dedicated to the two of them. Bu&ntilde;uel's Belle De Jour plays out like a dream state all the way to it's chilling finale, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

    First seeing Luis Bunuel's film here, there are a few surreal aspects to it, but the premise really is a young attractive wife of a doctor, who lives in Paris but is bored with her existence and has intimacy issues with her husband. It is very odd at first as we see her visiting with her husband Pierre's friends, at parties, etc...but really her mind is elsewhere, she wants a form of appreciation, obsession, perhaps lust or love. A woman is never quite sure, but knows when her husband is emotionally neglectful. She wanders the boutique shops of Paris, eventually wandering to Madame Anais' (Genevieve Page) brothel which is a small non-described building in the middle of the city. Initially, she is just curious and wanders in, asking about employment. Deneuve as Severine is beautiful here, her pale blonde hair, demure, and sensual. After awhile she is intrigued and Madame Anais makes up her alias "belle du jour", she works during the day, and encounters some very odd characters. One is an Asian businessman with a propensity for masochism, up to a motorcycle man with metal teeth, very strange. There are some interesting visuals with horse and carriage, bells, and a man with a death fetish. The visuals have to be seen to be appreciated. Basically addresses psychology of women, in a sense, and the sometime need for escapism in marriage. Recommended.

    Here is the fascinating depiction of a woman so badly damaged by incest that she can't relate to her loving husband and spends most of her time in a world of fantasy, where she is tortured and raped. Catherine Deneuve dazzles as the picture-perfect, emotionally detached housewife suffering aftereffects of abuse by her father. One day she takes her self-flagellation from the realm of the mind to the chambers of a bordello, where it's unattractive johns who slap her around and make her bleed. As if that weren't punishment enough, Belle takes a freelance job in which she lies in a coffin to play the dead daughter of an obsessive incest perpetrator -- "I hope you can forgive me, but I loved you so" -- who masturbates below her scantily clad body. Severine/Belle de Jour admits she doesn't understand why she engages in actions that humiliate and harm her. Her blind acting out eventually claims the life of her greatest supporter -- and at that point it's Severine who has become an abuser herself. The only way she can tolerate this realization is to withdraw once again into the world of make-believe. And now Severine's fantasy is a joyous one. She has healed but is lost to the world. This is an incredibly grim and pessimistic film. When I first saw "Belle" years ago, I could make little sense of it. At last, I think I understand.

    Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, probably the king of surrealist films, opens Belle de Jour, his first color film, with a couple of lingering shots and minimal sound which makes me feel like I was thrown in a different world or staring at beautiful paintings - which rightly sets the mood for 100 minutes of pure surreal movie experience. On the film's technical aspects, there is no background music except for the all-important bird/bell sounds; and the cinematography & lighting are not as visually satisfying as other films i've seen. It's probably intentional on Bu&ntilde;uel's part, I wouldn't know.. but it doesn't affect the quality of the film at all. The smooth/uninterrupted editing, I think is nicely done because the transition between Belle's fantasies & realities looks seamless which adds to the film's puzzling "which is which" reality. But the "fantasy" scenes, in my opinion, are just excellent in its simplicity, not too much garish artsy fartsy touch, but enough technical creativeness to give the audience a pure surreal treat. Not a bad choice for a Bu&ntilde;uel virgin. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing his masterful manipulation of his surrealist techniques and his tasteful execution of "sexual depravities" without having to resort to showing any nudity or crass sex scenes. At the end of the film, it's interesting to note that in a way, this is like a mix of Inception, The Housemaid, and Mulholland Drive, but satisfyingly less complicated. It doesn't mean that it won't leave you scratching your head, as Bu&ntilde;uel decides to keep this film open to your own interpretations. Catherine Deneuve IS Belle de Jour. I just love her in this one.

    As any emotion or idea is teased out in art cinema, Belle De Jour brings forth understanding of the complex notion of humanity's most damning conundrum: we want most what we cannot have. As love may be the most powerful of our emotions, not even it can save lovely Sevinne from self- destructing her perfect life. Many films explore the idea love deprivation and its effects, but this is the first I have seen which explores what happens when we actually get what we want. The seeming madness which ensues is meaningful because it makes sense; the progression is strangely not just plausible, but logical. A beautifully photographed piece of visual as well as narrative art, Belle De Jour is subtle in its themes, deterministic and yet random in its story. In other words, it is real....it leaves one with a haunting understanding of the true nature of the human animal.

    Catherine Deneuve puts on a masterful performance as a frigid housewife named "Severine Serizy" who loves her husband "Pierre Serizy" (Jean Sorel) very much but cannot satisfy him sexually because she was sexually abused in her childhood. Or at least, that is what the viewers are led to believe because she has fantasies and dreams which seem to take on a life of their own and one is never sure where the line is drawn at times. Be that as it may, while she apparently cannot have sexual relations with her husband, she still has needs and she becomes a prostitute to fulfill them. At first she is very scared and tentative, but as she continues to work she gains more experience and becomes more confident and relaxed. Unfortunately, complications arise and things begin to get out of control. Now, rather than divulging how the story ends, I will just say that it is open to interpretation and let the viewer decide for himself. Additionally, while the subject and some of the scenes are somewhat risqu&eacute;, there isn't a great deal of nudity or sex actually in this film. That said, depending on your point of view, that could be good or it could be bad. Regardless, I personally think Catherine Deneuve is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever grace the screen and I was delighted by her performance all the same.

    Amazingly good and surviving the necessary test of aging. Now I understand who Catherine Deneuve really is as an actress. She's simply great as Severine/Belle de Jour, and Bu&ntilde;uel is a genius. I thought it was impossible for me to watch this sixties' experiment, filmed the same year I was born, coincidentally. I read the book first back in the seventies, when I was maybe eight, nine years old, and I can't just begin to explain to you, oh good people, how reading that book had a certain effect on my erotic perception of the world in those faraway, bygone days, and I'm simply talking about my early and intense wanking pubescence activity. This film is so true to the original story and so well acted it hurts. The surrealistic management of time and places are all but a simple exercise in Belle de Jour, and that's when you understand what it means to be open-minded while you're watching a real piece of Seventh Art. Do not hesitate in watching and re-watching this movie, a production made back when art really meant something to film directors and to the public. Controversial as it is Nabokov/Kubric's Lolita, Belle de Jour contains some very un-PC scenes involving kids which would be banned, had they been filmed nowadays, because back in those days Political Correctness simply meant nothing and wasn't an impediment at all to the making of filmed art. I highly praise the moment I took away prejudices from my mind and decided to watch this movie for the first time after all these years. I was beautifully surprised and just couldn't stop watching till the end. And talking about the ending...., it has that special seal you know, like when you turn to see if someone else, someone maybe sitting beside you and who may or may not explain to you what the director really meant, you not being convinced at all by the happy ending it seems to portray the first time you watch it. And this comment may contain a spoiler, but Severine/Belle de Jour is so nuts she takes you away with her craziness until the very end, making you to want to believe there's a happy ending and not just another one of the mind- tricks she performs in order to introduce some balance into her strange, unreal reality. This film is, by all means, a real 10-star one, and one that shouldn't let you undisturbed. Thumbs up for the French avant-garde represented in this movie, not one of Bu&ntilde;uel's "little movies", as some pretend it is, but a postmodern classic in psychological drama. It has that dirty, corrupt air you get a taste of when dealing with songs like "Lemon incest", as recorded by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western/Mafia/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western/Mafia/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again: a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.

    After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour', I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel was trying to say. And if you asked Bu&ntilde;uel what the meaning of the film was, he probably would have told you 'it is, what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour', Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative. Bu&ntilde;uel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments, an idyllic carriage-ride (seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel) morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Bu&ntilde;uel's protagonist, S&eacute;verine (Catherine Deneuve) is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband, Pierre. But in a blink of an eye, Bu&ntilde;uel has the last laugh (or should I say the first laugh?) when we see that the assault on S&eacute;verine is a figment of her imagination. In reality, she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967. But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation, Bu&ntilde;uel is committed to shocking us again. S&eacute;verine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as S&eacute;verine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result, they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations. In reality, nothing is normal for S&eacute;verine--she must endure Husson, the boyfriend of the couple's friend, Ren&eacute;e, who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a high-class whorehouse. This is how S&eacute;verine finds out about Madame Ana&iuml;s' establishment, which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at, as a high-class call girl. While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child, Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in contrasting S&eacute;verine's life as an unhappy, chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Bu&ntilde;uel takes great pleasure in emphasizing S&eacute;verine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). S&eacute;verine also expresses disgust to Madame Ana&iuml;s. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies. Bu&ntilde;uel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who S&eacute;verine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with S&eacute;verine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive. Bu&ntilde;uel comes full circle playing with his audience. If S&eacute;verine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that S&eacute;verine refers to Pierre's "accident" as he sits in his wheelchair. An "accident" seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an "accident" (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of S&eacute;verine's imagination. The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and S&eacute;verine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Bu&ntilde;uel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now S&eacute;verine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on S&eacute;verine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death. For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.

Despite of its serious and heavy sounding subject, this actually remains a pretty fun movie to watch as well. This is all due to the unusual fantasies and the wishes of the customers the Catherine Deneuve character hooks up with, when she starts working as a part-time prostitute. The movie handles all of its themes very well and interesting, which gets you into the mind of the main character and understand her dilemmas and motivations. You don't ever condemn her, even though she is also committing adultery on her unknowing and somewhat too sweet and naive husband. It all got beautiful told and shot, thanks to Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's directing approach, which had always been more visually orientated. A great and original movie to watch! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    A hypnotic blend of fantasy and reality, Belle De Jour is the first film I've seen from Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and it certainly won't be the last. The opening scene is a memorable one, as Severine and Pierre Serizy (Catherine Deneuve and Jean Sorel) ride in a carriage through the woods, before he drags her out, ties her to a tree and has the drivers whip and rape her. This shocking image turns out to be just a fantasy of Severine's, but it immediately lets the viewer know that there is a caged erotic mind locked away underneath the titular character's frigid exterior. The film uses these fantasies frequently, and it's in Bu&ntilde;uel's approach to them that the film sets itself apart from the way others might use this meshing of truth and fiction. We are never given any warning signs that we are entering a dream state, there's never a blur or fade into them, he doesn't shoot them in a way unique from how he shoots her daily life, and thus Bu&ntilde;uel catches the audience in this world between worlds. Deneuve, ever alluring and catching of the eyes, walks through her life as a woman in a trance, stuck between her lurid fantasies and her more traditional reality, and Bu&ntilde;uel places the audience in this same spell. Severine is a mysterious character, one who dreams of being sexually humiliated and violated, yet for some reason she remains sterile within her own marriage, despite her husband's numerous efforts. Severine finds herself compelled by her sexual desires to enter employment at a local whorehouse, and in this world she is able to slowly reveal her inner nature. Belle De Jour is a character study in the most interesting sense, because it never aims to fully explore it's character. We are given the understanding of why she travels down the path she does, but the character ultimately remains an ambiguous mystery, both to the audience and perhaps to herself. It's plausible that even she doesn't know why she can't open herself physically to her husband, and her actions to explore her inner desires are a way not only for her to release her sexual frustration but also to try and understand what drives her. This approach to the character could have been cold and uninviting, shutting it's audience away from any level of interest, but with a team as skilled as Bu&ntilde;uel and Deneuve it becomes a fascinating journey into the mind of Severine, always compelling in it's refusal to give the audience the easy answers. The narrative takes a more direct turn with the introduction of Marcel (Pierre Clementi), a client for Severine who becomes dangerously obsessed with her and is the complete counter of Pierre. The introduction of Marcel was both a blessing and a curse for me, because while it advanced the narrative and Severine's personal struggles, I found myself so entertained by him and his partner in crime Hyppolite (Francisco Rabal) that I wanted to see a film entirely dedicated to the two of them. Bu&ntilde;uel's Belle De Jour plays out like a dream state all the way to it's chilling finale, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

    First seeing Luis Bunuel's film here, there are a few surreal aspects to it, but the premise really is a young attractive wife of a doctor, who lives in Paris but is bored with her existence and has intimacy issues with her husband. It is very odd at first as we see her visiting with her husband Pierre's friends, at parties, etc...but really her mind is elsewhere, she wants a form of appreciation, obsession, perhaps lust or love. A woman is never quite sure, but knows when her husband is emotionally neglectful. She wanders the boutique shops of Paris, eventually wandering to Madame Anais' (Genevieve Page) brothel which is a small non-described building in the middle of the city. Initially, she is just curious and wanders in, asking about employment. Deneuve as Severine is beautiful here, her pale blonde hair, demure, and sensual. After awhile she is intrigued and Madame Anais makes up her alias "belle du jour", she works during the day, and encounters some very odd characters. One is an Asian businessman with a propensity for masochism, up to a motorcycle man with metal teeth, very strange. There are some interesting visuals with horse and carriage, bells, and a man with a death fetish. The visuals have to be seen to be appreciated. Basically addresses psychology of women, in a sense, and the sometime need for escapism in marriage. Recommended.

    Here is the fascinating depiction of a woman so badly damaged by incest that she can't relate to her loving husband and spends most of her time in a world of fantasy, where she is tortured and raped. Catherine Deneuve dazzles as the picture-perfect, emotionally detached housewife suffering aftereffects of abuse by her father. One day she takes her self-flagellation from the realm of the mind to the chambers of a bordello, where it's unattractive johns who slap her around and make her bleed. As if that weren't punishment enough, Belle takes a freelance job in which she lies in a coffin to play the dead daughter of an obsessive incest perpetrator -- "I hope you can forgive me, but I loved you so" -- who masturbates below her scantily clad body. Severine/Belle de Jour admits she doesn't understand why she engages in actions that humiliate and harm her. Her blind acting out eventually claims the life of her greatest supporter -- and at that point it's Severine who has become an abuser herself. The only way she can tolerate this realization is to withdraw once again into the world of make-believe. And now Severine's fantasy is a joyous one. She has healed but is lost to the world. This is an incredibly grim and pessimistic film. When I first saw "Belle" years ago, I could make little sense of it. At last, I think I understand.

    Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, probably the king of surrealist films, opens Belle de Jour, his first color film, with a couple of lingering shots and minimal sound which makes me feel like I was thrown in a different world or staring at beautiful paintings - which rightly sets the mood for 100 minutes of pure surreal movie experience. On the film's technical aspects, there is no background music except for the all-important bird/bell sounds; and the cinematography & lighting are not as visually satisfying as other films i've seen. It's probably intentional on Bu&ntilde;uel's part, I wouldn't know.. but it doesn't affect the quality of the film at all. The smooth/uninterrupted editing, I think is nicely done because the transition between Belle's fantasies & realities looks seamless which adds to the film's puzzling "which is which" reality. But the "fantasy" scenes, in my opinion, are just excellent in its simplicity, not too much garish artsy fartsy touch, but enough technical creativeness to give the audience a pure surreal treat. Not a bad choice for a Bu&ntilde;uel virgin. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing his masterful manipulation of his surrealist techniques and his tasteful execution of "sexual depravities" without having to resort to showing any nudity or crass sex scenes. At the end of the film, it's interesting to note that in a way, this is like a mix of Inception, The Housemaid, and Mulholland Drive, but satisfyingly less complicated. It doesn't mean that it won't leave you scratching your head, as Bu&ntilde;uel decides to keep this film open to your own interpretations. Catherine Deneuve IS Belle de Jour. I just love her in this one.

    As any emotion or idea is teased out in art cinema, Belle De Jour brings forth understanding of the complex notion of humanity's most damning conundrum: we want most what we cannot have. As love may be the most powerful of our emotions, not even it can save lovely Sevinne from self- destructing her perfect life. Many films explore the idea love deprivation and its effects, but this is the first I have seen which explores what happens when we actually get what we want. The seeming madness which ensues is meaningful because it makes sense; the progression is strangely not just plausible, but logical. A beautifully photographed piece of visual as well as narrative art, Belle De Jour is subtle in its themes, deterministic and yet random in its story. In other words, it is real....it leaves one with a haunting understanding of the true nature of the human animal.

    Catherine Deneuve puts on a masterful performance as a frigid housewife named "Severine Serizy" who loves her husband "Pierre Serizy" (Jean Sorel) very much but cannot satisfy him sexually because she was sexually abused in her childhood. Or at least, that is what the viewers are led to believe because she has fantasies and dreams which seem to take on a life of their own and one is never sure where the line is drawn at times. Be that as it may, while she apparently cannot have sexual relations with her husband, she still has needs and she becomes a prostitute to fulfill them. At first she is very scared and tentative, but as she continues to work she gains more experience and becomes more confident and relaxed. Unfortunately, complications arise and things begin to get out of control. Now, rather than divulging how the story ends, I will just say that it is open to interpretation and let the viewer decide for himself. Additionally, while the subject and some of the scenes are somewhat risqu&eacute;, there isn't a great deal of nudity or sex actually in this film. That said, depending on your point of view, that could be good or it could be bad. Regardless, I personally think Catherine Deneuve is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever grace the screen and I was delighted by her performance all the same.

    Amazingly good and surviving the necessary test of aging. Now I understand who Catherine Deneuve really is as an actress. She's simply great as Severine/Belle de Jour, and Bu&ntilde;uel is a genius. I thought it was impossible for me to watch this sixties' experiment, filmed the same year I was born, coincidentally. I read the book first back in the seventies, when I was maybe eight, nine years old, and I can't just begin to explain to you, oh good people, how reading that book had a certain effect on my erotic perception of the world in those faraway, bygone days, and I'm simply talking about my early and intense wanking pubescence activity. This film is so true to the original story and so well acted it hurts. The surrealistic management of time and places are all but a simple exercise in Belle de Jour, and that's when you understand what it means to be open-minded while you're watching a real piece of Seventh Art. Do not hesitate in watching and re-watching this movie, a production made back when art really meant something to film directors and to the public. Controversial as it is Nabokov/Kubric's Lolita, Belle de Jour contains some very un-PC scenes involving kids which would be banned, had they been filmed nowadays, because back in those days Political Correctness simply meant nothing and wasn't an impediment at all to the making of filmed art. I highly praise the moment I took away prejudices from my mind and decided to watch this movie for the first time after all these years. I was beautifully surprised and just couldn't stop watching till the end. And talking about the ending...., it has that special seal you know, like when you turn to see if someone else, someone maybe sitting beside you and who may or may not explain to you what the director really meant, you not being convinced at all by the happy ending it seems to portray the first time you watch it. And this comment may contain a spoiler, but Severine/Belle de Jour is so nuts she takes you away with her craziness until the very end, making you to want to believe there's a happy ending and not just another one of the mind- tricks she performs in order to introduce some balance into her strange, unreal reality. This film is, by all means, a real 10-star one, and one that shouldn't let you undisturbed. Thumbs up for the French avant-garde represented in this movie, not one of Bu&ntilde;uel's "little movies", as some pretend it is, but a postmodern classic in psychological drama. It has that dirty, corrupt air you get a taste of when dealing with songs like "Lemon incest", as recorded by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western/Mafia/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western/Mafia/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again: a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.

    After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour', I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel was trying to say. And if you asked Bu&ntilde;uel what the meaning of the film was, he probably would have told you 'it is, what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour', Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative. Bu&ntilde;uel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments, an idyllic carriage-ride (seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel) morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Bu&ntilde;uel's protagonist, S&eacute;verine (Catherine Deneuve) is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband, Pierre. But in a blink of an eye, Bu&ntilde;uel has the last laugh (or should I say the first laugh?) when we see that the assault on S&eacute;verine is a figment of her imagination. In reality, she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967. But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation, Bu&ntilde;uel is committed to shocking us again. S&eacute;verine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as S&eacute;verine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result, they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations. In reality, nothing is normal for S&eacute;verine--she must endure Husson, the boyfriend of the couple's friend, Ren&eacute;e, who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a high-class whorehouse. This is how S&eacute;verine finds out about Madame Ana&iuml;s' establishment, which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at, as a high-class call girl. While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child, Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in contrasting S&eacute;verine's life as an unhappy, chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Bu&ntilde;uel takes great pleasure in emphasizing S&eacute;verine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). S&eacute;verine also expresses disgust to Madame Ana&iuml;s. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies. Bu&ntilde;uel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who S&eacute;verine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with S&eacute;verine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive. Bu&ntilde;uel comes full circle playing with his audience. If S&eacute;verine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that S&eacute;verine refers to Pierre's "accident" as he sits in his wheelchair. An "accident" seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an "accident" (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of S&eacute;verine's imagination. The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and S&eacute;verine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Bu&ntilde;uel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now S&eacute;verine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on S&eacute;verine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death. For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.

    Spanish-born Mexican screenwriter, producer, film editor and director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's twenty-fourth feature film which he co-wrote with French actor and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, is an adaptation of a novel from 1928 by French author and journalist Joseph Kessel. It was screened In competition at the 28th Venice International Film Festival in 1967, was shot on locations in Paris, France and is a French-Italy co-production which was produced by Egyptian brothers and producers Robert Hakim (1907-1992) and Raymond Hakim (1909-1980). It tells the story about S&eacute;verine Serizy, a insatiable, distant and noticeably attractive woman who lives in a dispirited marriage with her surgeon husband Pierre Serizy, who is very displeased with his young wife whom he finds cold and unkind. S&eacute;verine's life is restrained by her poor marriage and she only finds pleasure in her vivid fantasies, but her life changes significantly when she takes a day-job at a high-class brothel in Paris, France and meets a gangster named Marcel who seems to possess everything she is looking for and more. Distinctly and precisely directed by surrealist filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (1900-1983), this luminous and intricate fictional tale which is narrated from the protagonist's point of view, draws a singular portrayal of a complex femme fatale's strange experiences at a French house of prostitution and her fantasy-driven relationship with a wicked young man whilst leading a double life. While notable for it's diverse and atmospheric milieu depictions, stellar cinematography by French cinematographer Sacha Vierny (1919-2001), production design by French production designer Robert Clavel (1912-1999), costume design by costume designer H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Nourry, fine editing by film editor Louisette Hautecoeur and use of sound, this character-driven and dialog-driven psychological comedy-drama from the late 1960s where reality and dreams are entwined, depicts an intriguing and in-depth study of character about self-realization. This rhythmic, surreal, humorous, amoral and discreetly erotic story about a bourgeoisie housewife who has become so imprisoned by her unfulfilled desires that she has withdrawn herself into an imaginary internal world, is impelled and reinforced by it's colorful characters, substantial character development, fragmented narrative structure, the incomparable and unforgettable acting performance by French actress Catherine Deneauve in one of her most renowned roles and the fine supporting acting performances by French actor Pierre Cl&eacute;menti (1942-1999), French actress Gen&egrave;vieve Page and French actor Jean Sorel. A mysterious, picturesque and versatile modernist melodrama which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion at the 28th Venice Film Festival in 1967.

    Its story makes that this movie isn't anything usual to watch. But really, that should come as no surprise, since the movie got directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. A man who loved to create some surrealistic pictures, about unusual subjects. But as far as Luis Bu&ntilde;uel movie go, this one is pretty mainstream and straightforward. It still has some dreamlike sequences in it but overall its narrative, dialog and characters are easy to follow and understand, making this movie a perfectly accessible one for just about everybody. So really, don't let the name Luis Bu&ntilde;uel scare you off, if you are afraid for some artsy fartsy type of stuff. Really hardly any of that present in this movie, though it still remains something unique and stylish to watch. The movie and its story is being an exploration of a woman's sexual fantasies. And it's not the romantic and cute kind of stuff. Things like bondage and other masochism pass through this movie, which all seems to be in big contrast with the cute looking and soft spoken Catherine Deneuve character. But that also makes it work out, I guess. It keeps things surprising and interesting because you basically never know what you can expect next from her and where the movie will be going with everything. Despite of its serious and heavy sounding subject, this actually remains a pretty fun movie to watch as well. This is all due to the unusual fantasies and the wishes of the customers the Catherine Deneuve character hooks up with, when she starts working as a part-time prostitute. The movie handles all of its themes very well and interesting, which gets you into the mind of the main character and understand her dilemmas and motivations.

    Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, probably the king of surrealist films, opens Belle de Jour, his first color film, with a couple of lingering shots and minimal sound which makes me feel like I was thrown in a different world or staring at beautiful paintings - which rightly sets the mood for 100 minutes of pure surreal movie experience. On the film's technical aspects, there is no background music except for the all-important bird/bell sounds; and the cinematography & lighting are not as visually satisfying as other films i've seen. It's probably intentional on Bu&ntilde;uel's part, I wouldn't know.. but it doesn't affect the quality of the film at all. The smooth/uninterrupted editing, I think is nicely done because the transition between Belle's fantasies & realities looks seamless which adds to the film's puzzling "which is which" reality. But the "fantasy" scenes, in my opinion, are just excellent in its simplicity, not too much garish artsy fartsy touch, but enough technical creativeness to give the audience a pure surreal treat. Not a bad choice for a Bu&ntilde;uel virgin. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing his masterful manipulation of his surrealist techniques and his tasteful execution of "sexual depravities" without having to resort to showing any nudity or crass sex scenes. At the end of the film, it's interesting to note that in a way, this is like a mix of Inception, The Housemaid, and Mulholland Drive, but satisfyingly less complicated. It doesn't mean that it won't leave you scratching your head, as Bu&ntilde;uel decides to keep this film open to your own interpretations. Catherine Deneuve IS Belle de Jour. I just love her in this one.

    As any emotion or idea is teased out in art cinema, Belle De Jour brings forth understanding of the complex notion of humanity's most damning conundrum: we want most what we cannot have. As love may be the most powerful of our emotions, not even it can save lovely Sevinne from self- destructing her perfect life. Many films explore the idea love deprivation and its effects, but this is the first I have seen which explores what happens when we actually get what we want. The seeming madness which ensues is meaningful because it makes sense; the progression is strangely not just plausible, but logical. A beautifully photographed piece of visual as well as narrative art, Belle De Jour is subtle in its themes, deterministic and yet random in its story. In other words, it is real....it leaves one with a haunting understanding of the true nature of the human animal.

    Catherine Deneuve puts on a masterful performance as a frigid housewife named "Severine Serizy" who loves her husband "Pierre Serizy" (Jean Sorel) very much but cannot satisfy him sexually because she was sexually abused in her childhood. Or at least, that is what the viewers are led to believe because she has fantasies and dreams which seem to take on a life of their own and one is never sure where the line is drawn at times. Be that as it may, while she apparently cannot have sexual relations with her husband, she still has needs and she becomes a prostitute to fulfill them. At first she is very scared and tentative, but as she continues to work she gains more experience and becomes more confident and relaxed. Unfortunately, complications arise and things begin to get out of control. Now, rather than divulging how the story ends, I will just say that it is open to interpretation and let the viewer decide for himself. Additionally, while the subject and some of the scenes are somewhat risqu&eacute;, there isn't a great deal of nudity or sex actually in this film. That said, depending on your point of view, that could be good or it could be bad. Regardless, I personally think Catherine Deneuve is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever grace the screen and I was delighted by her performance all the same.

    Amazingly good and surviving the necessary test of aging. Now I understand who Catherine Deneuve really is as an actress. She's simply great as Severine/Belle de Jour, and Bu&ntilde;uel is a genius. I thought it was impossible for me to watch this sixties' experiment, filmed the same year I was born, coincidentally. I read the book first back in the seventies, when I was maybe eight, nine years old, and I can't just begin to explain to you, oh good people, how reading that book had a certain effect on my erotic perception of the world in those faraway, bygone days, and I'm simply talking about my early and intense wanking pubescence activity. This film is so true to the original story and so well acted it hurts. The surrealistic management of time and places are all but a simple exercise in Belle de Jour, and that's when you understand what it means to be open-minded while you're watching a real piece of Seventh Art. Do not hesitate in watching and re-watching this movie, a production made back when art really meant something to film directors and to the public. Controversial as it is Nabokov/Kubric's Lolita, Belle de Jour contains some very un-PC scenes involving kids which would be banned, had they been filmed nowadays, because back in those days Political Correctness simply meant nothing and wasn't an impediment at all to the making of filmed art. I highly praise the moment I took away prejudices from my mind and decided to watch this movie for the first time after all these years. I was beautifully surprised and just couldn't stop watching till the end. And talking about the ending...., it has that special seal you know, like when you turn to see if someone else, someone maybe sitting beside you and who may or may not explain to you what the director really meant, you not being convinced at all by the happy ending it seems to portray the first time you watch it. And this comment may contain a spoiler, but Severine/Belle de Jour is so nuts she takes you away with her craziness until the very end, making you to want to believe there's a happy ending and not just another one of the mind- tricks she performs in order to introduce some balance into her strange, unreal reality. This film is, by all means, a real 10-star one, and one that shouldn't let you undisturbed. Thumbs up for the French avant-garde represented in this movie, not one of Bu&ntilde;uel's "little movies", as some pretend it is, but a postmodern classic in psychological drama. It has that dirty, corrupt air you get a taste of when dealing with songs like "Lemon incest", as recorded by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western/Mafia/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western/Mafia/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again: a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.

    After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour', I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel was trying to say. And if you asked Bu&ntilde;uel what the meaning of the film was, he probably would have told you 'it is, what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour', Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative. Bu&ntilde;uel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments, an idyllic carriage-ride (seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel) morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Bu&ntilde;uel's protagonist, S&eacute;verine (Catherine Deneuve) is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband, Pierre. But in a blink of an eye, Bu&ntilde;uel has the last laugh (or should I say the first laugh?) when we see that the assault on S&eacute;verine is a figment of her imagination. In reality, she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967. But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation, Bu&ntilde;uel is committed to shocking us again. S&eacute;verine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as S&eacute;verine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result, they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations. In reality, nothing is normal for S&eacute;verine--she must endure Husson, the boyfriend of the couple's friend, Ren&eacute;e, who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a high-class whorehouse. This is how S&eacute;verine finds out about Madame Ana&iuml;s' establishment, which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at, as a high-class call girl. While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child, Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in contrasting S&eacute;verine's life as an unhappy, chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Bu&ntilde;uel takes great pleasure in emphasizing S&eacute;verine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). S&eacute;verine also expresses disgust to Madame Ana&iuml;s. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies. Bu&ntilde;uel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who S&eacute;verine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with S&eacute;verine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive. Bu&ntilde;uel comes full circle playing with his audience. If S&eacute;verine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that S&eacute;verine refers to Pierre's "accident" as he sits in his wheelchair. An "accident" seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an "accident" (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of S&eacute;verine's imagination. The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and S&eacute;verine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Bu&ntilde;uel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now S&eacute;verine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on S&eacute;verine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death. For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.

    Spanish-born Mexican screenwriter, producer, film editor and director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's twenty-fourth feature film which he co-wrote with French actor and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, is an adaptation of a novel from 1928 by French author and journalist Joseph Kessel. It was screened In competition at the 28th Venice International Film Festival in 1967, was shot on locations in Paris, France and is a French-Italy co-production which was produced by Egyptian brothers and producers Robert Hakim (1907-1992) and Raymond Hakim (1909-1980). It tells the story about S&eacute;verine Serizy, a insatiable, distant and noticeably attractive woman who lives in a dispirited marriage with her surgeon husband Pierre Serizy, who is very displeased with his young wife whom he finds cold and unkind. S&eacute;verine's life is restrained by her poor marriage and she only finds pleasure in her vivid fantasies, but her life changes significantly when she takes a day-job at a high-class brothel in Paris, France and meets a gangster named Marcel who seems to possess everything she is looking for and more. Distinctly and precisely directed by surrealist filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (1900-1983), this luminous and intricate fictional tale which is narrated from the protagonist's point of view, draws a singular portrayal of a complex femme fatale's strange experiences at a French house of prostitution and her fantasy-driven relationship with a wicked young man whilst leading a double life. While notable for it's diverse and atmospheric milieu depictions, stellar cinematography by French cinematographer Sacha Vierny (1919-2001), production design by French production designer Robert Clavel (1912-1999), costume design by costume designer H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Nourry, fine editing by film editor Louisette Hautecoeur and use of sound, this character-driven and dialog-driven psychological comedy-drama from the late 1960s where reality and dreams are entwined, depicts an intriguing and in-depth study of character about self-realization. This rhythmic, surreal, humorous, amoral and discreetly erotic story about a bourgeoisie housewife who has become so imprisoned by her unfulfilled desires that she has withdrawn herself into an imaginary internal world, is impelled and reinforced by it's colorful characters, substantial character development, fragmented narrative structure, the incomparable and unforgettable acting performance by French actress Catherine Deneauve in one of her most renowned roles and the fine supporting acting performances by French actor Pierre Cl&eacute;menti (1942-1999), French actress Gen&egrave;vieve Page and French actor Jean Sorel. A mysterious, picturesque and versatile modernist melodrama which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion at the 28th Venice Film Festival in 1967.

    Its story makes that this movie isn't anything usual to watch. But really, that should come as no surprise, since the movie got directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. A man who loved to create some surrealistic pictures, about unusual subjects. But as far as Luis Bu&ntilde;uel movie go, this one is pretty mainstream and straightforward. It still has some dreamlike sequences in it but overall its narrative, dialog and characters are easy to follow and understand, making this movie a perfectly accessible one for just about everybody. So really, don't let the name Luis Bu&ntilde;uel scare you off, if you are afraid for some artsy fartsy type of stuff. Really hardly any of that present in this movie, though it still remains something unique and stylish to watch. The movie and its story is being an exploration of a woman's sexual fantasies. And it's not the romantic and cute kind of stuff. Things like bondage and other masochism pass through this movie, which all seems to be in big contrast with the cute looking and soft spoken Catherine Deneuve character. But that also makes it work out, I guess. It keeps things surprising and interesting because you basically never know what you can expect next from her and where the movie will be going with everything. Despite of its serious and heavy sounding subject, this actually remains a pretty fun movie to watch as well. This is all due to the unusual fantasies and the wishes of the customers the Catherine Deneuve character hooks up with, when she starts working as a part-time prostitute. The movie handles all of its themes very well and interesting, which gets you into the mind of the main character and understand her dilemmas and motivations. You don't ever condemn her, even though she is also committing adultery on her unknowing and somewhat too sweet and naive husband. It all got beautiful told and shot, thanks to Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's directing approach, which had always been more visually orientated. A great and original movie to watch! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    A hypnotic blend of fantasy and reality, Belle De Jour is the first film I've seen from Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and it certainly won't be the last. The opening scene is a memorable one, as Severine and Pierre Serizy (Catherine Deneuve and Jean Sorel) ride in a carriage through the woods, before he drags her out, ties her to a tree and has the drivers whip and rape her. This shocking image turns out to be just a fantasy of Severine's, but it immediately lets the viewer know that there is a caged erotic mind locked away underneath the titular character's frigid exterior. The film uses these fantasies frequently, and it's in Bu&ntilde;uel's approach to them that the film sets itself apart from the way others might use this meshing of truth and fiction. We are never given any warning signs that we are entering a dream state, there's never a blur or fade into them, he doesn't shoot them in a way unique from how he shoots her daily life, and thus Bu&ntilde;uel catches the audience in this world between worlds. Deneuve, ever alluring and catching of the eyes, walks through her life as a woman in a trance, stuck between her lurid fantasies and her more traditional reality, and Bu&ntilde;uel places the audience in this same spell. Severine is a mysterious character, one who dreams of being sexually humiliated and violated, yet for some reason she remains sterile within her own marriage, despite her husband's numerous efforts. Severine finds herself compelled by her sexual desires to enter employment at a local whorehouse, and in this world she is able to slowly reveal her inner nature. Belle De Jour is a character study in the most interesting sense, because it never aims to fully explore it's character. We are given the understanding of why she travels down the path she does, but the character ultimately remains an ambiguous mystery, both to the audience and perhaps to herself. It's plausible that even she doesn't know why she can't open herself physically to her husband, and her actions to explore her inner desires are a way not only for her to release her sexual frustration but also to try and understand what drives her. This approach to the character could have been cold and uninviting, shutting it's audience away from any level of interest, but with a team as skilled as Bu&ntilde;uel and Deneuve it becomes a fascinating journey into the mind of Severine, always compelling in it's refusal to give the audience the easy answers. The narrative takes a more direct turn with the introduction of Marcel (Pierre Clementi), a client for Severine who becomes dangerously obsessed with her and is the complete counter of Pierre. The introduction of Marcel was both a blessing and a curse for me, because while it advanced the narrative and Severine's personal struggles, I found myself so entertained by him and his partner in crime Hyppolite (Francisco Rabal) that I wanted to see a film entirely dedicated to the two of them. Bu&ntilde;uel's Belle De Jour plays out like a dream state all the way to it's chilling finale, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

    First seeing Luis Bunuel's film here, there are a few surreal aspects to it, but the premise really is a young attractive wife of a doctor, who lives in Paris but is bored with her existence and has intimacy issues with her husband. It is very odd at first as we see her visiting with her husband Pierre's friends, at parties, etc...but really her mind is elsewhere, she wants a form of appreciation, obsession, perhaps lust or love. A woman is never quite sure, but knows when her husband is emotionally neglectful. She wanders the boutique shops of Paris, eventually wandering to Madame Anais' (Genevieve Page) brothel which is a small non-described building in the middle of the city. Initially, she is just curious and wanders in, asking about employment. Deneuve as Severine is beautiful here, her pale blonde hair, demure, and sensual. After awhile she is intrigued and Madame Anais makes up her alias "belle du jour", she works during the day, and encounters some very odd characters. One is an Asian businessman with a propensity for masochism, up to a motorcycle man with metal teeth, very strange. There are some interesting visuals with horse and carriage, bells, and a man with a death fetish. The visuals have to be seen to be appreciated. Basically addresses psychology of women, in a sense, and the sometime need for escapism in marriage. Recommended.

    Here is the fascinating depiction of a woman so badly damaged by incest that she can't relate to her loving husband and spends most of her time in a world of fantasy, where she is tortured and raped. Catherine Deneuve dazzles as the picture-perfect, emotionally detached housewife suffering aftereffects of abuse by her father. One day she takes her self-flagellation from the realm of the mind to the chambers of a bordello, where it's unattractive johns who slap her around and make her bleed. As if that weren't punishment enough, Belle takes a freelance job in which she lies in a coffin to play the dead daughter of an obsessive incest perpetrator -- "I hope you can forgive me, but I loved you so" -- who masturbates below her scantily clad body. Severine/Belle de Jour admits she doesn't understand why she engages in actions that humiliate and harm her. Her blind acting out eventually claims the life of her greatest supporter -- and at that point it's Severine who has become an abuser herself. The only way she can tolerate this realization is to withdraw once again into the world of make-believe. And now Severine's fantasy is a joyous one. She has healed but is lost to the world. This is an incredibly grim and pessimistic film. When I first saw "Belle" years ago, I could make little sense of it. At last, I think I understand.

It has that dirty, corrupt air you get a taste of when dealing with songs like "Lemon incest", as recorded by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western/Mafia/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western/Mafia/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again: a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.

    After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour', I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel was trying to say. And if you asked Bu&ntilde;uel what the meaning of the film was, he probably would have told you 'it is, what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour', Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative. Bu&ntilde;uel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments, an idyllic carriage-ride (seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel) morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Bu&ntilde;uel's protagonist, S&eacute;verine (Catherine Deneuve) is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband, Pierre. But in a blink of an eye, Bu&ntilde;uel has the last laugh (or should I say the first laugh?) when we see that the assault on S&eacute;verine is a figment of her imagination. In reality, she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967. But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation, Bu&ntilde;uel is committed to shocking us again. S&eacute;verine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as S&eacute;verine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result, they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations. In reality, nothing is normal for S&eacute;verine--she must endure Husson, the boyfriend of the couple's friend, Ren&eacute;e, who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a high-class whorehouse. This is how S&eacute;verine finds out about Madame Ana&iuml;s' establishment, which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at, as a high-class call girl. While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child, Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in contrasting S&eacute;verine's life as an unhappy, chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Bu&ntilde;uel takes great pleasure in emphasizing S&eacute;verine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). S&eacute;verine also expresses disgust to Madame Ana&iuml;s. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies. Bu&ntilde;uel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who S&eacute;verine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with S&eacute;verine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive. Bu&ntilde;uel comes full circle playing with his audience. If S&eacute;verine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that S&eacute;verine refers to Pierre's "accident" as he sits in his wheelchair. An "accident" seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an "accident" (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of S&eacute;verine's imagination. The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and S&eacute;verine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Bu&ntilde;uel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now S&eacute;verine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on S&eacute;verine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death. For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.

    Spanish-born Mexican screenwriter, producer, film editor and director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's twenty-fourth feature film which he co-wrote with French actor and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, is an adaptation of a novel from 1928 by French author and journalist Joseph Kessel. It was screened In competition at the 28th Venice International Film Festival in 1967, was shot on locations in Paris, France and is a French-Italy co-production which was produced by Egyptian brothers and producers Robert Hakim (1907-1992) and Raymond Hakim (1909-1980). It tells the story about S&eacute;verine Serizy, a insatiable, distant and noticeably attractive woman who lives in a dispirited marriage with her surgeon husband Pierre Serizy, who is very displeased with his young wife whom he finds cold and unkind. S&eacute;verine's life is restrained by her poor marriage and she only finds pleasure in her vivid fantasies, but her life changes significantly when she takes a day-job at a high-class brothel in Paris, France and meets a gangster named Marcel who seems to possess everything she is looking for and more. Distinctly and precisely directed by surrealist filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (1900-1983), this luminous and intricate fictional tale which is narrated from the protagonist's point of view, draws a singular portrayal of a complex femme fatale's strange experiences at a French house of prostitution and her fantasy-driven relationship with a wicked young man whilst leading a double life. While notable for it's diverse and atmospheric milieu depictions, stellar cinematography by French cinematographer Sacha Vierny (1919-2001), production design by French production designer Robert Clavel (1912-1999), costume design by costume designer H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Nourry, fine editing by film editor Louisette Hautecoeur and use of sound, this character-driven and dialog-driven psychological comedy-drama from the late 1960s where reality and dreams are entwined, depicts an intriguing and in-depth study of character about self-realization. This rhythmic, surreal, humorous, amoral and discreetly erotic story about a bourgeoisie housewife who has become so imprisoned by her unfulfilled desires that she has withdrawn herself into an imaginary internal world, is impelled and reinforced by it's colorful characters, substantial character development, fragmented narrative structure, the incomparable and unforgettable acting performance by French actress Catherine Deneauve in one of her most renowned roles and the fine supporting acting performances by French actor Pierre Cl&eacute;menti (1942-1999), French actress Gen&egrave;vieve Page and French actor Jean Sorel. A mysterious, picturesque and versatile modernist melodrama which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion at the 28th Venice Film Festival in 1967.

    Its story makes that this movie isn't anything usual to watch. But really, that should come as no surprise, since the movie got directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. A man who loved to create some surrealistic pictures, about unusual subjects. But as far as Luis Bu&ntilde;uel movie go, this one is pretty mainstream and straightforward. It still has some dreamlike sequences in it but overall its narrative, dialog and characters are easy to follow and understand, making this movie a perfectly accessible one for just about everybody. So really, don't let the name Luis Bu&ntilde;uel scare you off, if you are afraid for some artsy fartsy type of stuff. Really hardly any of that present in this movie, though it still remains something unique and stylish to watch. The movie and its story is being an exploration of a woman's sexual fantasies. And it's not the romantic and cute kind of stuff. Things like bondage and other masochism pass through this movie, which all seems to be in big contrast with the cute looking and soft spoken Catherine Deneuve character. But that also makes it work out, I guess. It keeps things surprising and interesting because you basically never know what you can expect next from her and where the movie will be going with everything. Despite of its serious and heavy sounding subject, this actually remains a pretty fun movie to watch as well. This is all due to the unusual fantasies and the wishes of the customers the Catherine Deneuve character hooks up with, when she starts working as a part-time prostitute. The movie handles all of its themes very well and interesting, which gets you into the mind of the main character and understand her dilemmas and motivations. You don't ever condemn her, even though she is also committing adultery on her unknowing and somewhat too sweet and naive husband. It all got beautiful told and shot, thanks to Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's directing approach, which had always been more visually orientated. A great and original movie to watch! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    A hypnotic blend of fantasy and reality, Belle De Jour is the first film I've seen from Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and it certainly won't be the last. The opening scene is a memorable one, as Severine and Pierre Serizy (Catherine Deneuve and Jean Sorel) ride in a carriage through the woods, before he drags her out, ties her to a tree and has the drivers whip and rape her. This shocking image turns out to be just a fantasy of Severine's, but it immediately lets the viewer know that there is a caged erotic mind locked away underneath the titular character's frigid exterior. The film uses these fantasies frequently, and it's in Bu&ntilde;uel's approach to them that the film sets itself apart from the way others might use this meshing of truth and fiction. We are never given any warning signs that we are entering a dream state, there's never a blur or fade into them, he doesn't shoot them in a way unique from how he shoots her daily life, and thus Bu&ntilde;uel catches the audience in this world between worlds. Deneuve, ever alluring and catching of the eyes, walks through her life as a woman in a trance, stuck between her lurid fantasies and her more traditional reality, and Bu&ntilde;uel places the audience in this same spell. Severine is a mysterious character, one who dreams of being sexually humiliated and violated, yet for some reason she remains sterile within her own marriage, despite her husband's numerous efforts. Severine finds herself compelled by her sexual desires to enter employment at a local whorehouse, and in this world she is able to slowly reveal her inner nature. Belle De Jour is a character study in the most interesting sense, because it never aims to fully explore it's character. We are given the understanding of why she travels down the path she does, but the character ultimately remains an ambiguous mystery, both to the audience and perhaps to herself. It's plausible that even she doesn't know why she can't open herself physically to her husband, and her actions to explore her inner desires are a way not only for her to release her sexual frustration but also to try and understand what drives her. This approach to the character could have been cold and uninviting, shutting it's audience away from any level of interest, but with a team as skilled as Bu&ntilde;uel and Deneuve it becomes a fascinating journey into the mind of Severine, always compelling in it's refusal to give the audience the easy answers. The narrative takes a more direct turn with the introduction of Marcel (Pierre Clementi), a client for Severine who becomes dangerously obsessed with her and is the complete counter of Pierre. The introduction of Marcel was both a blessing and a curse for me, because while it advanced the narrative and Severine's personal struggles, I found myself so entertained by him and his partner in crime Hyppolite (Francisco Rabal) that I wanted to see a film entirely dedicated to the two of them. Bu&ntilde;uel's Belle De Jour plays out like a dream state all the way to it's chilling finale, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

    First seeing Luis Bunuel's film here, there are a few surreal aspects to it, but the premise really is a young attractive wife of a doctor, who lives in Paris but is bored with her existence and has intimacy issues with her husband. It is very odd at first as we see her visiting with her husband Pierre's friends, at parties, etc...but really her mind is elsewhere, she wants a form of appreciation, obsession, perhaps lust or love. A woman is never quite sure, but knows when her husband is emotionally neglectful. She wanders the boutique shops of Paris, eventually wandering to Madame Anais' (Genevieve Page) brothel which is a small non-described building in the middle of the city. Initially, she is just curious and wanders in, asking about employment. Deneuve as Severine is beautiful here, her pale blonde hair, demure, and sensual. After awhile she is intrigued and Madame Anais makes up her alias "belle du jour", she works during the day, and encounters some very odd characters. One is an Asian businessman with a propensity for masochism, up to a motorcycle man with metal teeth, very strange. There are some interesting visuals with horse and carriage, bells, and a man with a death fetish. The visuals have to be seen to be appreciated. Basically addresses psychology of women, in a sense, and the sometime need for escapism in marriage. Recommended.

    Here is the fascinating depiction of a woman so badly damaged by incest that she can't relate to her loving husband and spends most of her time in a world of fantasy, where she is tortured and raped. Catherine Deneuve dazzles as the picture-perfect, emotionally detached housewife suffering aftereffects of abuse by her father. One day she takes her self-flagellation from the realm of the mind to the chambers of a bordello, where it's unattractive johns who slap her around and make her bleed. As if that weren't punishment enough, Belle takes a freelance job in which she lies in a coffin to play the dead daughter of an obsessive incest perpetrator -- "I hope you can forgive me, but I loved you so" -- who masturbates below her scantily clad body. Severine/Belle de Jour admits she doesn't understand why she engages in actions that humiliate and harm her. Her blind acting out eventually claims the life of her greatest supporter -- and at that point it's Severine who has become an abuser herself. The only way she can tolerate this realization is to withdraw once again into the world of make-believe. And now Severine's fantasy is a joyous one. She has healed but is lost to the world. This is an incredibly grim and pessimistic film. When I first saw "Belle" years ago, I could make little sense of it. At last, I think I understand.

    Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, probably the king of surrealist films, opens Belle de Jour, his first color film, with a couple of lingering shots and minimal sound which makes me feel like I was thrown in a different world or staring at beautiful paintings - which rightly sets the mood for 100 minutes of pure surreal movie experience. On the film's technical aspects, there is no background music except for the all-important bird/bell sounds; and the cinematography & lighting are not as visually satisfying as other films i've seen. It's probably intentional on Bu&ntilde;uel's part, I wouldn't know.. but it doesn't affect the quality of the film at all. The smooth/uninterrupted editing, I think is nicely done because the transition between Belle's fantasies & realities looks seamless which adds to the film's puzzling "which is which" reality. But the "fantasy" scenes, in my opinion, are just excellent in its simplicity, not too much garish artsy fartsy touch, but enough technical creativeness to give the audience a pure surreal treat. Not a bad choice for a Bu&ntilde;uel virgin. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing his masterful manipulation of his surrealist techniques and his tasteful execution of "sexual depravities" without having to resort to showing any nudity or crass sex scenes. At the end of the film, it's interesting to note that in a way, this is like a mix of Inception, The Housemaid, and Mulholland Drive, but satisfyingly less complicated. It doesn't mean that it won't leave you scratching your head, as Bu&ntilde;uel decides to keep this film open to your own interpretations. Catherine Deneuve IS Belle de Jour. I just love her in this one.

    As any emotion or idea is teased out in art cinema, Belle De Jour brings forth understanding of the complex notion of humanity's most damning conundrum: we want most what we cannot have. As love may be the most powerful of our emotions, not even it can save lovely Sevinne from self- destructing her perfect life. Many films explore the idea love deprivation and its effects, but this is the first I have seen which explores what happens when we actually get what we want. The seeming madness which ensues is meaningful because it makes sense; the progression is strangely not just plausible, but logical. A beautifully photographed piece of visual as well as narrative art, Belle De Jour is subtle in its themes, deterministic and yet random in its story. In other words, it is real....it leaves one with a haunting understanding of the true nature of the human animal.

    Catherine Deneuve puts on a masterful performance as a frigid housewife named "Severine Serizy" who loves her husband "Pierre Serizy" (Jean Sorel) very much but cannot satisfy him sexually because she was sexually abused in her childhood. Or at least, that is what the viewers are led to believe because she has fantasies and dreams which seem to take on a life of their own and one is never sure where the line is drawn at times. Be that as it may, while she apparently cannot have sexual relations with her husband, she still has needs and she becomes a prostitute to fulfill them. At first she is very scared and tentative, but as she continues to work she gains more experience and becomes more confident and relaxed. Unfortunately, complications arise and things begin to get out of control. Now, rather than divulging how the story ends, I will just say that it is open to interpretation and let the viewer decide for himself. Additionally, while the subject and some of the scenes are somewhat risqu&eacute;, there isn't a great deal of nudity or sex actually in this film. That said, depending on your point of view, that could be good or it could be bad. Regardless, I personally think Catherine Deneuve is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever grace the screen and I was delighted by her performance all the same.

    Amazingly good and surviving the necessary test of aging. Now I understand who Catherine Deneuve really is as an actress. She's simply great as Severine/Belle de Jour, and Bu&ntilde;uel is a genius. I thought it was impossible for me to watch this sixties' experiment, filmed the same year I was born, coincidentally. I read the book first back in the seventies, when I was maybe eight, nine years old, and I can't just begin to explain to you, oh good people, how reading that book had a certain effect on my erotic perception of the world in those faraway, bygone days, and I'm simply talking about my early and intense wanking pubescence activity. This film is so true to the original story and so well acted it hurts. The surrealistic management of time and places are all but a simple exercise in Belle de Jour, and that's when you understand what it means to be open-minded while you're watching a real piece of Seventh Art. Do not hesitate in watching and re-watching this movie, a production made back when art really meant something to film directors and to the public. Controversial as it is Nabokov/Kubric's Lolita, Belle de Jour contains some very un-PC scenes involving kids which would be banned, had they been filmed nowadays, because back in those days Political Correctness simply meant nothing and wasn't an impediment at all to the making of filmed art. I highly praise the moment I took away prejudices from my mind and decided to watch this movie for the first time after all these years. I was beautifully surprised and just couldn't stop watching till the end. And talking about the ending...., it has that special seal you know, like when you turn to see if someone else, someone maybe sitting beside you and who may or may not explain to you what the director really meant, you not being convinced at all by the happy ending it seems to portray the first time you watch it. And this comment may contain a spoiler, but Severine/Belle de Jour is so nuts she takes you away with her craziness until the very end, making you to want to believe there's a happy ending and not just another one of the mind- tricks she performs in order to introduce some balance into her strange, unreal reality. This film is, by all means, a real 10-star one, and one that shouldn't let you undisturbed. Thumbs up for the French avant-garde represented in this movie, not one of Bu&ntilde;uel's "little movies", as some pretend it is, but a postmodern classic in psychological drama. It has that dirty, corrupt air you get a taste of when dealing with songs like "Lemon incest", as recorded by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western/Mafia/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western/Mafia/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again: a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.

S&eacute;verine's life is restrained by her poor marriage and she only finds pleasure in her vivid fantasies, but her life changes significantly when she takes a day-job at a high-class brothel in Paris, France and meets a gangster named Marcel who seems to possess everything she is looking for and more. Distinctly and precisely directed by surrealist filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (1900-1983), this luminous and intricate fictional tale which is narrated from the protagonist's point of view, draws a singular portrayal of a complex femme fatale's strange experiences at a French house of prostitution and her fantasy-driven relationship with a wicked young man whilst leading a double life. While notable for it's diverse and atmospheric milieu depictions, stellar cinematography by French cinematographer Sacha Vierny (1919-2001), production design by French production designer Robert Clavel (1912-1999), costume design by costume designer H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Nourry, fine editing by film editor Louisette Hautecoeur and use of sound, this character-driven and dialog-driven psychological comedy-drama from the late 1960s where reality and dreams are entwined, depicts an intriguing and in-depth study of character about self-realization. This rhythmic, surreal, humorous, amoral and discreetly erotic story about a bourgeoisie housewife who has become so imprisoned by her unfulfilled desires that she has withdrawn herself into an imaginary internal world, is impelled and reinforced by it's colorful characters, substantial character development, fragmented narrative structure, the incomparable and unforgettable acting performance by French actress Catherine Deneauve in one of her most renowned roles and the fine supporting acting performances by French actor Pierre Cl&eacute;menti (1942-1999), French actress Gen&egrave;vieve Page and French actor Jean Sorel. A mysterious, picturesque and versatile modernist melodrama which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion at the 28th Venice Film Festival in 1967.

    Its story makes that this movie isn't anything usual to watch. But really, that should come as no surprise, since the movie got directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. A man who loved to create some surrealistic pictures, about unusual subjects. But as far as Luis Bu&ntilde;uel movie go, this one is pretty mainstream and straightforward. It still has some dreamlike sequences in it but overall its narrative, dialog and characters are easy to follow and understand, making this movie a perfectly accessible one for just about everybody. So really, don't let the name Luis Bu&ntilde;uel scare you off, if you are afraid for some artsy fartsy type of stuff. Really hardly any of that present in this movie, though it still remains something unique and stylish to watch. The movie and its story is being an exploration of a woman's sexual fantasies. And it's not the romantic and cute kind of stuff. Things like bondage and other masochism pass through this movie, which all seems to be in big contrast with the cute looking and soft spoken Catherine Deneuve character. But that also makes it work out, I guess. It keeps things surprising and interesting because you basically never know what you can expect next from her and where the movie will be going with everything. Despite of its serious and heavy sounding subject, this actually remains a pretty fun movie to watch as well. This is all due to the unusual fantasies and the wishes of the customers the Catherine Deneuve character hooks up with, when she starts working as a part-time prostitute. The movie handles all of its themes very well and interesting, which gets you into the mind of the main character and understand her dilemmas and motivations. You don't ever condemn her, even though she is also committing adultery on her unknowing and somewhat too sweet and naive husband. It all got beautiful told and shot, thanks to Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's directing approach, which had always been more visually orientated. A great and original movie to watch! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    A hypnotic blend of fantasy and reality, Belle De Jour is the first film I've seen from Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and it certainly won't be the last. The opening scene is a memorable one, as Severine and Pierre Serizy (Catherine Deneuve and Jean Sorel) ride in a carriage through the woods, before he drags her out, ties her to a tree and has the drivers whip and rape her. This shocking image turns out to be just a fantasy of Severine's, but it immediately lets the viewer know that there is a caged erotic mind locked away underneath the titular character's frigid exterior. The film uses these fantasies frequently, and it's in Bu&ntilde;uel's approach to them that the film sets itself apart from the way others might use this meshing of truth and fiction. We are never given any warning signs that we are entering a dream state, there's never a blur or fade into them, he doesn't shoot them in a way unique from how he shoots her daily life, and thus Bu&ntilde;uel catches the audience in this world between worlds. Deneuve, ever alluring and catching of the eyes, walks through her life as a woman in a trance, stuck between her lurid fantasies and her more traditional reality, and Bu&ntilde;uel places the audience in this same spell. Severine is a mysterious character, one who dreams of being sexually humiliated and violated, yet for some reason she remains sterile within her own marriage, despite her husband's numerous efforts. Severine finds herself compelled by her sexual desires to enter employment at a local whorehouse, and in this world she is able to slowly reveal her inner nature. Belle De Jour is a character study in the most interesting sense, because it never aims to fully explore it's character. We are given the understanding of why she travels down the path she does, but the character ultimately remains an ambiguous mystery, both to the audience and perhaps to herself. It's plausible that even she doesn't know why she can't open herself physically to her husband, and her actions to explore her inner desires are a way not only for her to release her sexual frustration but also to try and understand what drives her. This approach to the character could have been cold and uninviting, shutting it's audience away from any level of interest, but with a team as skilled as Bu&ntilde;uel and Deneuve it becomes a fascinating journey into the mind of Severine, always compelling in it's refusal to give the audience the easy answers. The narrative takes a more direct turn with the introduction of Marcel (Pierre Clementi), a client for Severine who becomes dangerously obsessed with her and is the complete counter of Pierre. The introduction of Marcel was both a blessing and a curse for me, because while it advanced the narrative and Severine's personal struggles, I found myself so entertained by him and his partner in crime Hyppolite (Francisco Rabal) that I wanted to see a film entirely dedicated to the two of them. Bu&ntilde;uel's Belle De Jour plays out like a dream state all the way to it's chilling finale, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

    First seeing Luis Bunuel's film here, there are a few surreal aspects to it, but the premise really is a young attractive wife of a doctor, who lives in Paris but is bored with her existence and has intimacy issues with her husband. It is very odd at first as we see her visiting with her husband Pierre's friends, at parties, etc...but really her mind is elsewhere, she wants a form of appreciation, obsession, perhaps lust or love. A woman is never quite sure, but knows when her husband is emotionally neglectful. She wanders the boutique shops of Paris, eventually wandering to Madame Anais' (Genevieve Page) brothel which is a small non-described building in the middle of the city. Initially, she is just curious and wanders in, asking about employment. Deneuve as Severine is beautiful here, her pale blonde hair, demure, and sensual. After awhile she is intrigued and Madame Anais makes up her alias "belle du jour", she works during the day, and encounters some very odd characters. One is an Asian businessman with a propensity for masochism, up to a motorcycle man with metal teeth, very strange. There are some interesting visuals with horse and carriage, bells, and a man with a death fetish. The visuals have to be seen to be appreciated. Basically addresses psychology of women, in a sense, and the sometime need for escapism in marriage. Recommended.

    Here is the fascinating depiction of a woman so badly damaged by incest that she can't relate to her loving husband and spends most of her time in a world of fantasy, where she is tortured and raped. Catherine Deneuve dazzles as the picture-perfect, emotionally detached housewife suffering aftereffects of abuse by her father. One day she takes her self-flagellation from the realm of the mind to the chambers of a bordello, where it's unattractive johns who slap her around and make her bleed. As if that weren't punishment enough, Belle takes a freelance job in which she lies in a coffin to play the dead daughter of an obsessive incest perpetrator -- "I hope you can forgive me, but I loved you so" -- who masturbates below her scantily clad body. Severine/Belle de Jour admits she doesn't understand why she engages in actions that humiliate and harm her. Her blind acting out eventually claims the life of her greatest supporter -- and at that point it's Severine who has become an abuser herself. The only way she can tolerate this realization is to withdraw once again into the world of make-believe. And now Severine's fantasy is a joyous one. She has healed but is lost to the world. This is an incredibly grim and pessimistic film. When I first saw "Belle" years ago, I could make little sense of it. At last, I think I understand.

    Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, probably the king of surrealist films, opens Belle de Jour, his first color film, with a couple of lingering shots and minimal sound which makes me feel like I was thrown in a different world or staring at beautiful paintings - which rightly sets the mood for 100 minutes of pure surreal movie experience. On the film's technical aspects, there is no background music except for the all-important bird/bell sounds; and the cinematography & lighting are not as visually satisfying as other films i've seen. It's probably intentional on Bu&ntilde;uel's part, I wouldn't know.. but it doesn't affect the quality of the film at all. The smooth/uninterrupted editing, I think is nicely done because the transition between Belle's fantasies & realities looks seamless which adds to the film's puzzling "which is which" reality. But the "fantasy" scenes, in my opinion, are just excellent in its simplicity, not too much garish artsy fartsy touch, but enough technical creativeness to give the audience a pure surreal treat. Not a bad choice for a Bu&ntilde;uel virgin. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing his masterful manipulation of his surrealist techniques and his tasteful execution of "sexual depravities" without having to resort to showing any nudity or crass sex scenes. At the end of the film, it's interesting to note that in a way, this is like a mix of Inception, The Housemaid, and Mulholland Drive, but satisfyingly less complicated. It doesn't mean that it won't leave you scratching your head, as Bu&ntilde;uel decides to keep this film open to your own interpretations. Catherine Deneuve IS Belle de Jour. I just love her in this one.

    As any emotion or idea is teased out in art cinema, Belle De Jour brings forth understanding of the complex notion of humanity's most damning conundrum: we want most what we cannot have. As love may be the most powerful of our emotions, not even it can save lovely Sevinne from self- destructing her perfect life. Many films explore the idea love deprivation and its effects, but this is the first I have seen which explores what happens when we actually get what we want. The seeming madness which ensues is meaningful because it makes sense; the progression is strangely not just plausible, but logical. A beautifully photographed piece of visual as well as narrative art, Belle De Jour is subtle in its themes, deterministic and yet random in its story. In other words, it is real....it leaves one with a haunting understanding of the true nature of the human animal.

    Catherine Deneuve puts on a masterful performance as a frigid housewife named "Severine Serizy" who loves her husband "Pierre Serizy" (Jean Sorel) very much but cannot satisfy him sexually because she was sexually abused in her childhood. Or at least, that is what the viewers are led to believe because she has fantasies and dreams which seem to take on a life of their own and one is never sure where the line is drawn at times. Be that as it may, while she apparently cannot have sexual relations with her husband, she still has needs and she becomes a prostitute to fulfill them. At first she is very scared and tentative, but as she continues to work she gains more experience and becomes more confident and relaxed. Unfortunately, complications arise and things begin to get out of control. Now, rather than divulging how the story ends, I will just say that it is open to interpretation and let the viewer decide for himself. Additionally, while the subject and some of the scenes are somewhat risqu&eacute;, there isn't a great deal of nudity or sex actually in this film. That said, depending on your point of view, that could be good or it could be bad. Regardless, I personally think Catherine Deneuve is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever grace the screen and I was delighted by her performance all the same.

    Amazingly good and surviving the necessary test of aging. Now I understand who Catherine Deneuve really is as an actress. She's simply great as Severine/Belle de Jour, and Bu&ntilde;uel is a genius. I thought it was impossible for me to watch this sixties' experiment, filmed the same year I was born, coincidentally. I read the book first back in the seventies, when I was maybe eight, nine years old, and I can't just begin to explain to you, oh good people, how reading that book had a certain effect on my erotic perception of the world in those faraway, bygone days, and I'm simply talking about my early and intense wanking pubescence activity. This film is so true to the original story and so well acted it hurts. The surrealistic management of time and places are all but a simple exercise in Belle de Jour, and that's when you understand what it means to be open-minded while you're watching a real piece of Seventh Art. Do not hesitate in watching and re-watching this movie, a production made back when art really meant something to film directors and to the public. Controversial as it is Nabokov/Kubric's Lolita, Belle de Jour contains some very un-PC scenes involving kids which would be banned, had they been filmed nowadays, because back in those days Political Correctness simply meant nothing and wasn't an impediment at all to the making of filmed art. I highly praise the moment I took away prejudices from my mind and decided to watch this movie for the first time after all these years. I was beautifully surprised and just couldn't stop watching till the end. And talking about the ending...., it has that special seal you know, like when you turn to see if someone else, someone maybe sitting beside you and who may or may not explain to you what the director really meant, you not being convinced at all by the happy ending it seems to portray the first time you watch it. And this comment may contain a spoiler, but Severine/Belle de Jour is so nuts she takes you away with her craziness until the very end, making you to want to believe there's a happy ending and not just another one of the mind- tricks she performs in order to introduce some balance into her strange, unreal reality. This film is, by all means, a real 10-star one, and one that shouldn't let you undisturbed. Thumbs up for the French avant-garde represented in this movie, not one of Bu&ntilde;uel's "little movies", as some pretend it is, but a postmodern classic in psychological drama. It has that dirty, corrupt air you get a taste of when dealing with songs like "Lemon incest", as recorded by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western/Mafia/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western/Mafia/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again: a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.

    After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour', I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel was trying to say. And if you asked Bu&ntilde;uel what the meaning of the film was, he probably would have told you 'it is, what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour', Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative. Bu&ntilde;uel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments, an idyllic carriage-ride (seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel) morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Bu&ntilde;uel's protagonist, S&eacute;verine (Catherine Deneuve) is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband, Pierre. But in a blink of an eye, Bu&ntilde;uel has the last laugh (or should I say the first laugh?) when we see that the assault on S&eacute;verine is a figment of her imagination. In reality, she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967. But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation, Bu&ntilde;uel is committed to shocking us again. S&eacute;verine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as S&eacute;verine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result, they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations. In reality, nothing is normal for S&eacute;verine--she must endure Husson, the boyfriend of the couple's friend, Ren&eacute;e, who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a high-class whorehouse. This is how S&eacute;verine finds out about Madame Ana&iuml;s' establishment, which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at, as a high-class call girl. While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child, Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in contrasting S&eacute;verine's life as an unhappy, chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Bu&ntilde;uel takes great pleasure in emphasizing S&eacute;verine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). S&eacute;verine also expresses disgust to Madame Ana&iuml;s. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies. Bu&ntilde;uel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who S&eacute;verine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with S&eacute;verine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive. Bu&ntilde;uel comes full circle playing with his audience. If S&eacute;verine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that S&eacute;verine refers to Pierre's "accident" as he sits in his wheelchair. An "accident" seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an "accident" (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of S&eacute;verine's imagination. The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and S&eacute;verine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Bu&ntilde;uel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now S&eacute;verine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on S&eacute;verine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death. For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.

The introduction of Marcel was both a blessing and a curse for me, because while it advanced the narrative and Severine's personal struggles, I found myself so entertained by him and his partner in crime Hyppolite (Francisco Rabal) that I wanted to see a film entirely dedicated to the two of them. Bu&ntilde;uel's Belle De Jour plays out like a dream state all the way to it's chilling finale, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

    First seeing Luis Bunuel's film here, there are a few surreal aspects to it, but the premise really is a young attractive wife of a doctor, who lives in Paris but is bored with her existence and has intimacy issues with her husband. It is very odd at first as we see her visiting with her husband Pierre's friends, at parties, etc...but really her mind is elsewhere, she wants a form of appreciation, obsession, perhaps lust or love. A woman is never quite sure, but knows when her husband is emotionally neglectful. She wanders the boutique shops of Paris, eventually wandering to Madame Anais' (Genevieve Page) brothel which is a small non-described building in the middle of the city. Initially, she is just curious and wanders in, asking about employment. Deneuve as Severine is beautiful here, her pale blonde hair, demure, and sensual. After awhile she is intrigued and Madame Anais makes up her alias "belle du jour", she works during the day, and encounters some very odd characters. One is an Asian businessman with a propensity for masochism, up to a motorcycle man with metal teeth, very strange. There are some interesting visuals with horse and carriage, bells, and a man with a death fetish. The visuals have to be seen to be appreciated. Basically addresses psychology of women, in a sense, and the sometime need for escapism in marriage. Recommended.

    Here is the fascinating depiction of a woman so badly damaged by incest that she can't relate to her loving husband and spends most of her time in a world of fantasy, where she is tortured and raped. Catherine Deneuve dazzles as the picture-perfect, emotionally detached housewife suffering aftereffects of abuse by her father. One day she takes her self-flagellation from the realm of the mind to the chambers of a bordello, where it's unattractive johns who slap her around and make her bleed. As if that weren't punishment enough, Belle takes a freelance job in which she lies in a coffin to play the dead daughter of an obsessive incest perpetrator -- "I hope you can forgive me, but I loved you so" -- who masturbates below her scantily clad body. Severine/Belle de Jour admits she doesn't understand why she engages in actions that humiliate and harm her. Her blind acting out eventually claims the life of her greatest supporter -- and at that point it's Severine who has become an abuser herself. The only way she can tolerate this realization is to withdraw once again into the world of make-believe. And now Severine's fantasy is a joyous one. She has healed but is lost to the world. This is an incredibly grim and pessimistic film. When I first saw "Belle" years ago, I could make little sense of it. At last, I think I understand.

    Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, probably the king of surrealist films, opens Belle de Jour, his first color film, with a couple of lingering shots and minimal sound which makes me feel like I was thrown in a different world or staring at beautiful paintings - which rightly sets the mood for 100 minutes of pure surreal movie experience. On the film's technical aspects, there is no background music except for the all-important bird/bell sounds; and the cinematography & lighting are not as visually satisfying as other films i've seen. It's probably intentional on Bu&ntilde;uel's part, I wouldn't know.. but it doesn't affect the quality of the film at all. The smooth/uninterrupted editing, I think is nicely done because the transition between Belle's fantasies & realities looks seamless which adds to the film's puzzling "which is which" reality. But the "fantasy" scenes, in my opinion, are just excellent in its simplicity, not too much garish artsy fartsy touch, but enough technical creativeness to give the audience a pure surreal treat. Not a bad choice for a Bu&ntilde;uel virgin. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing his masterful manipulation of his surrealist techniques and his tasteful execution of "sexual depravities" without having to resort to showing any nudity or crass sex scenes. At the end of the film, it's interesting to note that in a way, this is like a mix of Inception, The Housemaid, and Mulholland Drive, but satisfyingly less complicated. It doesn't mean that it won't leave you scratching your head, as Bu&ntilde;uel decides to keep this film open to your own interpretations. Catherine Deneuve IS Belle de Jour. I just love her in this one.

    As any emotion or idea is teased out in art cinema, Belle De Jour brings forth understanding of the complex notion of humanity's most damning conundrum: we want most what we cannot have. As love may be the most powerful of our emotions, not even it can save lovely Sevinne from self- destructing her perfect life. Many films explore the idea love deprivation and its effects, but this is the first I have seen which explores what happens when we actually get what we want. The seeming madness which ensues is meaningful because it makes sense; the progression is strangely not just plausible, but logical. A beautifully photographed piece of visual as well as narrative art, Belle De Jour is subtle in its themes, deterministic and yet random in its story. In other words, it is real....it leaves one with a haunting understanding of the true nature of the human animal.

    Catherine Deneuve puts on a masterful performance as a frigid housewife named "Severine Serizy" who loves her husband "Pierre Serizy" (Jean Sorel) very much but cannot satisfy him sexually because she was sexually abused in her childhood. Or at least, that is what the viewers are led to believe because she has fantasies and dreams which seem to take on a life of their own and one is never sure where the line is drawn at times. Be that as it may, while she apparently cannot have sexual relations with her husband, she still has needs and she becomes a prostitute to fulfill them. At first she is very scared and tentative, but as she continues to work she gains more experience and becomes more confident and relaxed. Unfortunately, complications arise and things begin to get out of control. Now, rather than divulging how the story ends, I will just say that it is open to interpretation and let the viewer decide for himself. Additionally, while the subject and some of the scenes are somewhat risqu&eacute;, there isn't a great deal of nudity or sex actually in this film. That said, depending on your point of view, that could be good or it could be bad. Regardless, I personally think Catherine Deneuve is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever grace the screen and I was delighted by her performance all the same.

    Amazingly good and surviving the necessary test of aging. Now I understand who Catherine Deneuve really is as an actress. She's simply great as Severine/Belle de Jour, and Bu&ntilde;uel is a genius. I thought it was impossible for me to watch this sixties' experiment, filmed the same year I was born, coincidentally. I read the book first back in the seventies, when I was maybe eight, nine years old, and I can't just begin to explain to you, oh good people, how reading that book had a certain effect on my erotic perception of the world in those faraway, bygone days, and I'm simply talking about my early and intense wanking pubescence activity. This film is so true to the original story and so well acted it hurts. The surrealistic management of time and places are all but a simple exercise in Belle de Jour, and that's when you understand what it means to be open-minded while you're watching a real piece of Seventh Art. Do not hesitate in watching and re-watching this movie, a production made back when art really meant something to film directors and to the public. Controversial as it is Nabokov/Kubric's Lolita, Belle de Jour contains some very un-PC scenes involving kids which would be banned, had they been filmed nowadays, because back in those days Political Correctness simply meant nothing and wasn't an impediment at all to the making of filmed art. I highly praise the moment I took away prejudices from my mind and decided to watch this movie for the first time after all these years. I was beautifully surprised and just couldn't stop watching till the end. And talking about the ending...., it has that special seal you know, like when you turn to see if someone else, someone maybe sitting beside you and who may or may not explain to you what the director really meant, you not being convinced at all by the happy ending it seems to portray the first time you watch it. And this comment may contain a spoiler, but Severine/Belle de Jour is so nuts she takes you away with her craziness until the very end, making you to want to believe there's a happy ending and not just another one of the mind- tricks she performs in order to introduce some balance into her strange, unreal reality. This film is, by all means, a real 10-star one, and one that shouldn't let you undisturbed. Thumbs up for the French avant-garde represented in this movie, not one of Bu&ntilde;uel's "little movies", as some pretend it is, but a postmodern classic in psychological drama. It has that dirty, corrupt air you get a taste of when dealing with songs like "Lemon incest", as recorded by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western/Mafia/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western/Mafia/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again: a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.

    After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour', I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel was trying to say. And if you asked Bu&ntilde;uel what the meaning of the film was, he probably would have told you 'it is, what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour', Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative. Bu&ntilde;uel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments, an idyllic carriage-ride (seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel) morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Bu&ntilde;uel's protagonist, S&eacute;verine (Catherine Deneuve) is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband, Pierre. But in a blink of an eye, Bu&ntilde;uel has the last laugh (or should I say the first laugh?) when we see that the assault on S&eacute;verine is a figment of her imagination. In reality, she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967. But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation, Bu&ntilde;uel is committed to shocking us again. S&eacute;verine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as S&eacute;verine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result, they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations. In reality, nothing is normal for S&eacute;verine--she must endure Husson, the boyfriend of the couple's friend, Ren&eacute;e, who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a high-class whorehouse. This is how S&eacute;verine finds out about Madame Ana&iuml;s' establishment, which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at, as a high-class call girl. While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child, Bu&ntilde;uel is more interested in contrasting S&eacute;verine's life as an unhappy, chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Bu&ntilde;uel takes great pleasure in emphasizing S&eacute;verine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). S&eacute;verine also expresses disgust to Madame Ana&iuml;s. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies. Bu&ntilde;uel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who S&eacute;verine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with S&eacute;verine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive. Bu&ntilde;uel comes full circle playing with his audience. If S&eacute;verine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that S&eacute;verine refers to Pierre's "accident" as he sits in his wheelchair. An "accident" seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an "accident" (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of S&eacute;verine's imagination. The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and S&eacute;verine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Bu&ntilde;uel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now S&eacute;verine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on S&eacute;verine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death. For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.

    Spanish-born Mexican screenwriter, producer, film editor and director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's twenty-fourth feature film which he co-wrote with French actor and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, is an adaptation of a novel from 1928 by French author and journalist Joseph Kessel. It was screened In competition at the 28th Venice International Film Festival in 1967, was shot on locations in Paris, France and is a French-Italy co-production which was produced by Egyptian brothers and producers Robert Hakim (1907-1992) and Raymond Hakim (1909-1980). It tells the story about S&eacute;verine Serizy, a insatiable, distant and noticeably attractive woman who lives in a dispirited marriage with her surgeon husband Pierre Serizy, who is very displeased with his young wife whom he finds cold and unkind. S&eacute;verine's life is restrained by her poor marriage and she only finds pleasure in her vivid fantasies, but her life changes significantly when she takes a day-job at a high-class brothel in Paris, France and meets a gangster named Marcel who seems to possess everything she is looking for and more. Distinctly and precisely directed by surrealist filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (1900-1983), this luminous and intricate fictional tale which is narrated from the protagonist's point of view, draws a singular portrayal of a complex femme fatale's strange experiences at a French house of prostitution and her fantasy-driven relationship with a wicked young man whilst leading a double life. While notable for it's diverse and atmospheric milieu depictions, stellar cinematography by French cinematographer Sacha Vierny (1919-2001), production design by French production designer Robert Clavel (1912-1999), costume design by costume designer H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Nourry, fine editing by film editor Louisette Hautecoeur and use of sound, this character-driven and dialog-driven psychological comedy-drama from the late 1960s where reality and dreams are entwined, depicts an intriguing and in-depth study of character about self-realization. This rhythmic, surreal, humorous, amoral and discreetly erotic story about a bourgeoisie housewife who has become so imprisoned by her unfulfilled desires that she has withdrawn herself into an imaginary internal world, is impelled and reinforced by it's colorful characters, substantial character development, fragmented narrative structure, the incomparable and unforgettable acting performance by French actress Catherine Deneauve in one of her most renowned roles and the fine supporting acting performances by French actor Pierre Cl&eacute;menti (1942-1999), French actress Gen&egrave;vieve Page and French actor Jean Sorel. A mysterious, picturesque and versatile modernist melodrama which gained, among other awards, the Golden Lion at the 28th Venice Film Festival in 1967.

    Its story makes that this movie isn't anything usual to watch. But really, that should come as no surprise, since the movie got directed by Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. A man who loved to create some surrealistic pictures, about unusual subjects. But as far as Luis Bu&ntilde;uel movie go, this one is pretty mainstream and straightforward. It still has some dreamlike sequences in it but overall its narrative, dialog and characters are easy to follow and understand, making this movie a perfectly accessible one for just about everybody. So really, don't let the name Luis Bu&ntilde;uel scare you off, if you are afraid for some artsy fartsy type of stuff. Really hardly any of that present in this movie, though it still remains something unique and stylish to watch. The movie and its story is being an exploration of a woman's sexual fantasies. And it's not the romantic and cute kind of stuff. Things like bondage and other masochism pass through this movie, which all seems to be in big contrast with the cute looking and soft spoken Catherine Deneuve character. But that also makes it work out, I guess. It keeps things surprising and interesting because you basically never know what you can expect next from her and where the movie will be going with everything. Despite of its serious and heavy sounding subject, this actually remains a pretty fun movie to watch as well. This is all due to the unusual fantasies and the wishes of the customers the Catherine Deneuve character hooks up with, when she starts working as a part-time prostitute. The movie handles all of its themes very well and interesting, which gets you into the mind of the main character and understand her dilemmas and motivations. You don't ever condemn her, even though she is also committing adultery on her unknowing and somewhat too sweet and naive husband. It all got beautiful told and shot, thanks to Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's directing approach, which had always been more visually orientated. A great and original movie to watch! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    A hypnotic blend of fantasy and reality, Belle De Jour is the first film I've seen from Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and it certainly won't be the last. The opening scene is a memorable one, as Severine and Pierre Serizy (Catherine Deneuve and Jean Sorel) ride in a carriage through the woods, before he drags her out, ties her to a tree and has the drivers whip and rape her. This shocking image turns out to be just a fantasy of Severine's, but it immediately lets the viewer know that there is a caged erotic mind locked away underneath the titular character's frigid exterior. The film uses these fantasies frequently, and it's in Bu&ntilde;uel's approach to them that the film sets itself apart from the way others might use this meshing of truth and fiction. We are never given any warning signs that we are entering a dream state, there's never a blur or fade into them, he doesn't shoot them in a way unique from how he shoots her daily life, and thus Bu&ntilde;uel catches the audience in this world between worlds. Deneuve, ever alluring and catching of the eyes, walks through her life as a woman in a trance, stuck between her lurid fantasies and her more traditional reality, and Bu&ntilde;uel places the audience in this same spell. Severine is a mysterious character, one who dreams of being sexually humiliated and violated, yet for some reason she remains sterile within her own marriage, despite her husband's numerous efforts. Severine finds herself compelled by her sexual desires to enter employment at a local whorehouse, and in this world she is able to slowly reveal her inner nature. Belle De Jour is a character study in the most interesting sense, because it never aims to fully explore it's character. We are given the understanding of why she travels down the path she does, but the character ultimately remains an ambiguous mystery, both to the audience and perhaps to herself. It's plausible that even she doesn't know why she can't open herself physically to her husband, and her actions to explore her inner desires are a way not only for her to release her sexual frustration but also to try and understand what drives her. This approach to the character could have been cold and uninviting, shutting it's audience away from any level of interest, but with a team as skilled as Bu&ntilde;uel and Deneuve it becomes a fascinating journey into the mind of Severine, always compelling in it's refusal to give the audience the easy answers. The narrative takes a more direct turn with the introduction of Marcel (Pierre Clementi), a client for Severine who becomes dangerously obsessed with her and is the complete counter of Pierre. The introduction of Marcel was both a blessing and a curse for me, because while it advanced the narrative and Severine's personal struggles, I found myself so entertained by him and his partner in crime Hyppolite (Francisco Rabal) that I wanted to see a film entirely dedicated to the two of them. Bu&ntilde;uel's Belle De Jour plays out like a dream state all the way to it's chilling finale, and I wouldn't want it any other way.
