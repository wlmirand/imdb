    Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan play Jeff & Amy Taylor, who are traveling by car across country to California. After stopping at a gas station, they develop engine trouble in the middle of the desert. Desperate, his wife agrees to a ride with a friendly trucker(played memorably by J.T. Walsh), who promises to get them help. When she doesn't return(and after the car starts working again) Jeff drives back into town, only to find to his dismay that not only isn't his wife there, but that they never showed up at all. He does find the trucker, only to be shocked when told by him that he doesn't know what he's talking about! Thus begins a game of cat and mouse, hunter and hunted between Jeff and a particularly nasty gang of kidnappers, demanding ransom. Extremely exciting film involves the viewer with the couple's plight right away, and seldom goes wrong. Direction by Jonathan Mostow is efficient and inspired, and the performances really ring true, as does the smart script, leading to a cliffhanging climax. Cautionary tale about not going along with strangers works well as a variation on "Duel". Not to be missed.

    The always engaging screen veteran Kurt Russell and his real-life good friend, the late, great J.T. Walsh, make for entertaining adversaries in this relentlessly tense and lightning paced movie that delivers the thrills in a big way. It has basically realistic characters doing basically believable things, which puts "Breakdown" above other movies of its type. Kurt stars as Jeff Taylor, a man moving from Boston to San Diego with his wife Amy (Kathleen Quinlan). They've had some money problems and are hoping for a change in their fortunes. What happens is that their car breaks down in the country. Along comes a trucker named Red (Walsh) who offers to drive them to a place where they can phone for help. Jeff opts to stay with the car, and when he tries to hook up with Amy at the agreed rendezvous point, she's nowhere to be found. Jeff frantically tries to search for her, with little to no help from anybody, and ends up in some pretty hair raising episodes as he gets caught up in a plot hatched by some very bad guys. Kurt is fantastic as an ordinary guy who is forced to do some extraordinary things. He's not your standard movie hero who faces everything stoically and with a quip for every dangerous occasion; he's actually frightened and out of his depth but still determined to find his mate. Quinlan can't do much with a role that disappears from the story for a while, but she's as appealing as she's ever been. Walsh is perfect malevolent fun as a really evil bastard with an unsuspecting wife (Moira Sinise) and kid (Vincent Berry). Director Jonathan Mostow, who also co-wrote the screenplay based on his own story, has his movie hit the ground running and never stop moving. It emphasizes the isolation of the surroundings at every turn and keeps coming up with obstacles for its hero to overcome. It's also commendable in the way that it shows villains who have to change their modus operandi when their scheme doesn't work out as they wanted it to. There's also a chilling moment when Jeff is staring at a bulletin board littered with scores of posters of missing persons. "100,000 people go missing in this country every year," says a deputy, and we don't disbelieve him. Lots of wonderful scenery, and music by Basil Poledouris that matches the movies' pace, help a great deal, as well as a solid supporting cast including M.C. Gainey and Jack Noseworthy as two of the accomplices, Rex Linn as the level headed police chief, and Jack McGee as a cranky bartender. "Breakdown" is just pure entertainment that moves along to a rather brutal conclusion. It comes highly recommended to any fan of this genre. Eight out of 10.

    I started watching this movie thinking it would be one of those never ending races down the road, but happily, it was not. "Breakdown" begins with a couple facing problems with their car, when a trucker offers them a ride. Only the female accepts, whilst the male stays there to fix that. After that, he simply can't find her anymore. Of course there are a bunch of bandits behind this, and it is impressive to see how cold and mean they are. This great characterization of the gangster is due to great acting, along with a professional directing. Even thought I usually dislike movies involving kidnapping, mainly with action scenes, this one strongly entertained me, and 93 minutes just passed by in a minute. "Breakdown" leaves you in the edge of your seat, making you hate the villains very hard and cheer for the main couple, which makes it a GREAT film for all audiences.

    This is a really brilliant film. From the opening scene, and the overlying music, this gives the appearance of being made by someone who knows what they're doing. Step forward and take a bow, Jonathan Mostow and Basil Poledouris. Apparently this is the second score, as the first one was rejected. Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as Amy Taylor and Kurt Russell as husband Jeff. But really there isn't a weak point in the cast. The cinematography is excellent. The pacing and development of the story is first rate. One of the film's strengths is that you're never really sure who is a good guy and who's in on the act. I guess I could have done without some of the ridiculous actionman stuff in the latter stages. It would have been a better thriller if it concentrated on the psychological, which is sort of how it started. But overall you just can't stop watching it, and that's the hallmark of a good thriller. Nine out of ten.

    I just saw this movie again for the first time since it was released in '97 and it was just as scary now as ever before. I love the open road and enjoy long drives but after recently watching this movie again I may have to re think my love of the open highway! Yikes!! Kurt Russell is great in this film as the hapless husband who tries to rescue his wife from the group of crazies who are holding her for ransom. But without spoiling the plot, this movie does remind me of one of the other really scary rod trip movie Wolf Creek. Both movie have slightly similar overtones of nutty backwoods (or back roads) people who kidnap innocent passerbys. This movie held me to the edge of my seat due to the suspenseful plot. Check it out but be sure to lock your car doors and check the rear view mirror!

    It takes a lot for me to designate a thriller as utterly and completely mesmerizing, but such is the case with the 1997 Kurt Russell vehicle Breakdown. I stumbled upon this gem when it was released on VHS some 10+ years ago, and, as I recently browsed the somewhat deflated selection of films available in my "Watch Instantly" Netflix queue, decided to give it another go. Once again diving headlong into this ballet of desert highway carnage was like getting reacquainted with an old friend; consequently, this has caused me to lament the stale-by- comparison state of many recent "road rage thrillers" offered up by Hollywood. If you've never seen Breakdown, it could be described as a more intelligent version of Joy Ride (or, perhaps, The Hitcher). It's about a married couple named Jeff (Russell) and Amy (Quinlan) who are driving cross countryfrom Boston to San Diegoto take on more lucrative employment opportunities. Along the way, they almost collide with a local in a pick-up truck on a remote desert highway. When they stop at the next gas station, the fella driving the trucka black-clad hombre with a handlebar mustache and a cowboy hatproceeds to chew out Jeff for his idiotic behavior behind the wheel. The two eventually call a truce, part ways, and go about their lives. It's not long, however, before Jeff's brand new Jeep inexplicably breaks down. As the couple is trying to assess the situation, a man in an 18-wheeler stops, offers assistance, and eventually ends up suggesting the pair ride with him to the nearest town so they can call a tow truck. Jeff is leery about leaving his car on the side of a highway with a local lunatic on the prowl, so Amy hops in the semi, presumably to wait for her husband at a diner as he figures out what to do. Once she leaves, Jeff discovers the problem, fixes the car, and heads to the diner. When he gets there, though, Amy is nowhere to be found. The locals have no idea who she is, and they all claim to have never seen her. What ensues is a maddeningly wild goose chase across barren southwestern terrain as Jeff does everything in his power to find his spouse. There are twists and turns aplenty, and the action is great. The most disturbing thing about the film is how genuine it all seems. I have no trouble believing that something like this could (and perhaps has) occur in such remote locales, and there's a real sense of desperation to everything that's unfolding. Russell is great as the panicked husband who knows he's going to have to take things to the extreme to get his wife back, and almostalmostevery one of his decisions seems completely rational. The movie does give way to certain conventions from time to time, and I wish it would've built up the paranoia just a little longer before the "big reveal" occurs (a la Arlington Road), but there's no denying the intensity on display here. That being said, who's ready for a road trip?

    I expected more from this film. It starts out promisingly. One could believe that a strangely hostile redneck from some unidentifiable place out West might be resentful of airbrushed yuppies who stray into his territory from Massachusetts. Early on, the film succeeds in creating a squirmy sense of claustrophobic danger. But then it degenerates into boilerplate cat-and-mouse stuff when you see the bad guys are only after cash. For the most part, the characterization also failed to satisfy. Kurt Russell starts out looking wimpy against the sinister provocation of M.C. Gainey's Earl. But he winds up engaging in all kinds of acrobatic derring-do, scrambling over rooftops and hanging onto truck undercarriages, and it's just not credible. We're told nothing about Jeff's background but somehow I doubt these talents. Kathleen Quinlan did OK in the nothing role of Jeff's wife and J.T. Walsh was pretty effective as a two-faced kidnapper. I was saddened to read on Wikipedia that he died a year after this film was released, at age 53, during a stay at a cleansing-type retreat. In all this was disappointing but I'm not sorry I saw it.

    This movie is a combination of Duel and Joy Ride and I think it works out to be greater then either of them. It seems people are scared of truckers because so many movies come out where the truckers are these bad people. The acting was great and the story line was thrilling and intense. This movie is about a man and his wife who are travelling through the desert on the way to their new home. Their car breaks down on the way and a trucker stops and picks up his wife so she can go to the nearest phone and call a tow truck. But when the husband gets his car started as goes to where they were supposed to meet he finds out she never arrived and the hunt for his wife begins. This movie is probably the best of these trucker thriller movies for sure. And whats more its probably Kurt Russels best movie even though his acting got a bit shaky in the more emotional scenes.

    Boy, do I have quite the story on my search for this movie. I first saw this on late night television around 2000 when I was about 14. I loved the movie, but I didn't know what the title was and my parents didn't have cable or a TV guide. So I took it in my own hands to find the movie, no matter how long it took or how I got it. I searched every video store in my town. And I mean everything. Every blockbuster, Hollywood Video, every back section of a grocery store, everything. After five unsuccessful years of searching, I gave up. But two years later, in 2007, I got back into it. Nothing again for two years. So after giving up on that, I decided to use Yahoo Answers. I finally got it.... after three tries. To be finished at a later date.

    BREAKDOWN is one of those lower-budgeted, under-the-radar type movies which pop up on late night television to hook and fascinate you. In essence, it's a B-movie with a better cast than usual; one of those films I saw and liked years and years ago and which has stayed with me ever since. I recently revisited the film on DVD and was surprised to discover that it's actually an excellent little action/mystery/thriller and one of my all-time favourites. The ever under-appreciated Kurt Russell stars as that classic archetype, the ordinary guy, who finds himself out of his depth when his wife goes missing after hitching a ride with a seemingly kindly trucker. I won't spoil what happens after that, only to saw that the screenplay is absolutely loaded with suspense. Truly, you could hear a pin drop as I sat watching this film, riveted to the screen; the bank scene is the real highlight, but the later antics pay off nicely too. Things culminate with a nicely directed action scene featuring some great car stunts. Much of the film's success comes from the casting of Russell, whose acting adds immeasurably to the experience. He's one of those instantly identifiable and likable actors who you end up rooting for from the outset, even in more conflicted roles like the one he played in corrupt cop yarn DARK BLUE. If only Tarantino's DEATH PROOF had been more like this movie! Instead, the directorial duties are handled by Jonathan Mostow, his debut picture, and he does a wonderful job. I equally enjoyed his follow-up films, U-571 and even TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, although I'll admit that SURROGATES was a little lacking in the substance stakes. J. T. Walsh also does a nice job in a supporting role, and it's fun to see M. C. Gainey given something larger than a cameo for a change.

    This movie is a combination of Duel and Joy Ride and I think it works out to be greater then either of them. It seems people are scared of truckers because so many movies come out where the truckers are these bad people. The acting was great and the story line was thrilling and intense. This movie is about a man and his wife who are travelling through the desert on the way to their new home. Their car breaks down on the way and a trucker stops and picks up his wife so she can go to the nearest phone and call a tow truck. But when the husband gets his car started as goes to where they were supposed to meet he finds out she never arrived and the hunt for his wife begins. This movie is probably the best of these trucker thriller movies for sure. And whats more its probably Kurt Russels best movie even though his acting got a bit shaky in the more emotional scenes.

    Boy, do I have quite the story on my search for this movie. I first saw this on late night television around 2000 when I was about 14. I loved the movie, but I didn't know what the title was and my parents didn't have cable or a TV guide. So I took it in my own hands to find the movie, no matter how long it took or how I got it. I searched every video store in my town. And I mean everything. Every blockbuster, Hollywood Video, every back section of a grocery store, everything. After five unsuccessful years of searching, I gave up. But two years later, in 2007, I got back into it. Nothing again for two years. So after giving up on that, I decided to use Yahoo Answers. I finally got it.... after three tries. To be finished at a later date.

    BREAKDOWN is one of those lower-budgeted, under-the-radar type movies which pop up on late night television to hook and fascinate you. In essence, it's a B-movie with a better cast than usual; one of those films I saw and liked years and years ago and which has stayed with me ever since. I recently revisited the film on DVD and was surprised to discover that it's actually an excellent little action/mystery/thriller and one of my all-time favourites. The ever under-appreciated Kurt Russell stars as that classic archetype, the ordinary guy, who finds himself out of his depth when his wife goes missing after hitching a ride with a seemingly kindly trucker. I won't spoil what happens after that, only to saw that the screenplay is absolutely loaded with suspense. Truly, you could hear a pin drop as I sat watching this film, riveted to the screen; the bank scene is the real highlight, but the later antics pay off nicely too. Things culminate with a nicely directed action scene featuring some great car stunts. Much of the film's success comes from the casting of Russell, whose acting adds immeasurably to the experience. He's one of those instantly identifiable and likable actors who you end up rooting for from the outset, even in more conflicted roles like the one he played in corrupt cop yarn DARK BLUE. If only Tarantino's DEATH PROOF had been more like this movie! Instead, the directorial duties are handled by Jonathan Mostow, his debut picture, and he does a wonderful job. I equally enjoyed his follow-up films, U-571 and even TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, although I'll admit that SURROGATES was a little lacking in the substance stakes. J. T. Walsh also does a nice job in a supporting role, and it's fun to see M. C. Gainey given something larger than a cameo for a change.

    Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan play Jeff & Amy Taylor, who are traveling by car across country to California. After stopping at a gas station, they develop engine trouble in the middle of the desert. Desperate, his wife agrees to a ride with a friendly trucker(played memorably by J.T. Walsh), who promises to get them help. When she doesn't return(and after the car starts working again) Jeff drives back into town, only to find to his dismay that not only isn't his wife there, but that they never showed up at all. He does find the trucker, only to be shocked when told by him that he doesn't know what he's talking about! Thus begins a game of cat and mouse, hunter and hunted between Jeff and a particularly nasty gang of kidnappers, demanding ransom. Extremely exciting film involves the viewer with the couple's plight right away, and seldom goes wrong. Direction by Jonathan Mostow is efficient and inspired, and the performances really ring true, as does the smart script, leading to a cliffhanging climax. Cautionary tale about not going along with strangers works well as a variation on "Duel". Not to be missed.

    The always engaging screen veteran Kurt Russell and his real-life good friend, the late, great J.T. Walsh, make for entertaining adversaries in this relentlessly tense and lightning paced movie that delivers the thrills in a big way. It has basically realistic characters doing basically believable things, which puts "Breakdown" above other movies of its type. Kurt stars as Jeff Taylor, a man moving from Boston to San Diego with his wife Amy (Kathleen Quinlan). They've had some money problems and are hoping for a change in their fortunes. What happens is that their car breaks down in the country. Along comes a trucker named Red (Walsh) who offers to drive them to a place where they can phone for help. Jeff opts to stay with the car, and when he tries to hook up with Amy at the agreed rendezvous point, she's nowhere to be found. Jeff frantically tries to search for her, with little to no help from anybody, and ends up in some pretty hair raising episodes as he gets caught up in a plot hatched by some very bad guys. Kurt is fantastic as an ordinary guy who is forced to do some extraordinary things. He's not your standard movie hero who faces everything stoically and with a quip for every dangerous occasion; he's actually frightened and out of his depth but still determined to find his mate. Quinlan can't do much with a role that disappears from the story for a while, but she's as appealing as she's ever been. Walsh is perfect malevolent fun as a really evil bastard with an unsuspecting wife (Moira Sinise) and kid (Vincent Berry). Director Jonathan Mostow, who also co-wrote the screenplay based on his own story, has his movie hit the ground running and never stop moving. It emphasizes the isolation of the surroundings at every turn and keeps coming up with obstacles for its hero to overcome. It's also commendable in the way that it shows villains who have to change their modus operandi when their scheme doesn't work out as they wanted it to. There's also a chilling moment when Jeff is staring at a bulletin board littered with scores of posters of missing persons. "100,000 people go missing in this country every year," says a deputy, and we don't disbelieve him. Lots of wonderful scenery, and music by Basil Poledouris that matches the movies' pace, help a great deal, as well as a solid supporting cast including M.C. Gainey and Jack Noseworthy as two of the accomplices, Rex Linn as the level headed police chief, and Jack McGee as a cranky bartender. "Breakdown" is just pure entertainment that moves along to a rather brutal conclusion. It comes highly recommended to any fan of this genre. Eight out of 10.

    I started watching this movie thinking it would be one of those never ending races down the road, but happily, it was not. "Breakdown" begins with a couple facing problems with their car, when a trucker offers them a ride. Only the female accepts, whilst the male stays there to fix that. After that, he simply can't find her anymore. Of course there are a bunch of bandits behind this, and it is impressive to see how cold and mean they are. This great characterization of the gangster is due to great acting, along with a professional directing. Even thought I usually dislike movies involving kidnapping, mainly with action scenes, this one strongly entertained me, and 93 minutes just passed by in a minute. "Breakdown" leaves you in the edge of your seat, making you hate the villains very hard and cheer for the main couple, which makes it a GREAT film for all audiences.

Step forward and take a bow, Jonathan Mostow and Basil Poledouris. Apparently this is the second score, as the first one was rejected. Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as Amy Taylor and Kurt Russell as husband Jeff. But really there isn't a weak point in the cast. The cinematography is excellent. The pacing and development of the story is first rate. One of the film's strengths is that you're never really sure who is a good guy and who's in on the act. I guess I could have done without some of the ridiculous actionman stuff in the latter stages. It would have been a better thriller if it concentrated on the psychological, which is sort of how it started. But overall you just can't stop watching it, and that's the hallmark of a good thriller.

    I just saw this movie again for the first time since it was released in '97 and it was just as scary now as ever before. I love the open road and enjoy long drives but after recently watching this movie again I may have to re think my love of the open highway! Yikes!! Kurt Russell is great in this film as the hapless husband who tries to rescue his wife from the group of crazies who are holding her for ransom. But without spoiling the plot, this movie does remind me of one of the other really scary rod trip movie Wolf Creek. Both movie have slightly similar overtones of nutty backwoods (or back roads) people who kidnap innocent passerbys. This movie held me to the edge of my seat due to the suspenseful plot. Check it out but be sure to lock your car doors and check the rear view mirror!

    It takes a lot for me to designate a thriller as utterly and completely mesmerizing, but such is the case with the 1997 Kurt Russell vehicle Breakdown. I stumbled upon this gem when it was released on VHS some 10+ years ago, and, as I recently browsed the somewhat deflated selection of films available in my "Watch Instantly" Netflix queue, decided to give it another go. Once again diving headlong into this ballet of desert highway carnage was like getting reacquainted with an old friend; consequently, this has caused me to lament the stale-by- comparison state of many recent "road rage thrillers" offered up by Hollywood. If you've never seen Breakdown, it could be described as a more intelligent version of Joy Ride (or, perhaps, The Hitcher). It's about a married couple named Jeff (Russell) and Amy (Quinlan) who are driving cross countryfrom Boston to San Diegoto take on more lucrative employment opportunities. Along the way, they almost collide with a local in a pick-up truck on a remote desert highway. When they stop at the next gas station, the fella driving the trucka black-clad hombre with a handlebar mustache and a cowboy hatproceeds to chew out Jeff for his idiotic behavior behind the wheel. The two eventually call a truce, part ways, and go about their lives. It's not long, however, before Jeff's brand new Jeep inexplicably breaks down. As the couple is trying to assess the situation, a man in an 18-wheeler stops, offers assistance, and eventually ends up suggesting the pair ride with him to the nearest town so they can call a tow truck. Jeff is leery about leaving his car on the side of a highway with a local lunatic on the prowl, so Amy hops in the semi, presumably to wait for her husband at a diner as he figures out what to do. Once she leaves, Jeff discovers the problem, fixes the car, and heads to the diner. When he gets there, though, Amy is nowhere to be found. The locals have no idea who she is, and they all claim to have never seen her. What ensues is a maddeningly wild goose chase across barren southwestern terrain as Jeff does everything in his power to find his spouse. There are twists and turns aplenty, and the action is great. The most disturbing thing about the film is how genuine it all seems. I have no trouble believing that something like this could (and perhaps has) occur in such remote locales, and there's a real sense of desperation to everything that's unfolding. Russell is great as the panicked husband who knows he's going to have to take things to the extreme to get his wife back, and almostalmostevery one of his decisions seems completely rational. The movie does give way to certain conventions from time to time, and I wish it would've built up the paranoia just a little longer before the "big reveal" occurs (a la Arlington Road), but there's no denying the intensity on display here. That being said, who's ready for a road trip?

    I expected more from this film. It starts out promisingly. One could believe that a strangely hostile redneck from some unidentifiable place out West might be resentful of airbrushed yuppies who stray into his territory from Massachusetts. Early on, the film succeeds in creating a squirmy sense of claustrophobic danger. But then it degenerates into boilerplate cat-and-mouse stuff when you see the bad guys are only after cash. For the most part, the characterization also failed to satisfy. Kurt Russell starts out looking wimpy against the sinister provocation of M.C. Gainey's Earl. But he winds up engaging in all kinds of acrobatic derring-do, scrambling over rooftops and hanging onto truck undercarriages, and it's just not credible. We're told nothing about Jeff's background but somehow I doubt these talents. Kathleen Quinlan did OK in the nothing role of Jeff's wife and J.T. Walsh was pretty effective as a two-faced kidnapper. I was saddened to read on Wikipedia that he died a year after this film was released, at age 53, during a stay at a cleansing-type retreat. In all this was disappointing but I'm not sorry I saw it.

    I expected more from this film. It starts out promisingly. One could believe that a strangely hostile redneck from some unidentifiable place out West might be resentful of airbrushed yuppies who stray into his territory from Massachusetts. Early on, the film succeeds in creating a squirmy sense of claustrophobic danger. But then it degenerates into boilerplate cat-and-mouse stuff when you see the bad guys are only after cash. For the most part, the characterization also failed to satisfy. Kurt Russell starts out looking wimpy against the sinister provocation of M.C. Gainey's Earl. But he winds up engaging in all kinds of acrobatic derring-do, scrambling over rooftops and hanging onto truck undercarriages, and it's just not credible. We're told nothing about Jeff's background but somehow I doubt these talents. Kathleen Quinlan did OK in the nothing role of Jeff's wife and J.T. Walsh was pretty effective as a two-faced kidnapper. I was saddened to read on Wikipedia that he died a year after this film was released, at age 53, during a stay at a cleansing-type retreat. In all this was disappointing but I'm not sorry I saw it.

    This movie is a combination of Duel and Joy Ride and I think it works out to be greater then either of them. It seems people are scared of truckers because so many movies come out where the truckers are these bad people. The acting was great and the story line was thrilling and intense. This movie is about a man and his wife who are travelling through the desert on the way to their new home. Their car breaks down on the way and a trucker stops and picks up his wife so she can go to the nearest phone and call a tow truck. But when the husband gets his car started as goes to where they were supposed to meet he finds out she never arrived and the hunt for his wife begins. This movie is probably the best of these trucker thriller movies for sure. And whats more its probably Kurt Russels best movie even though his acting got a bit shaky in the more emotional scenes.

    Boy, do I have quite the story on my search for this movie. I first saw this on late night television around 2000 when I was about 14. I loved the movie, but I didn't know what the title was and my parents didn't have cable or a TV guide. So I took it in my own hands to find the movie, no matter how long it took or how I got it. I searched every video store in my town. And I mean everything. Every blockbuster, Hollywood Video, every back section of a grocery store, everything. After five unsuccessful years of searching, I gave up. But two years later, in 2007, I got back into it. Nothing again for two years. So after giving up on that, I decided to use Yahoo Answers. I finally got it.... after three tries. To be finished at a later date.

    BREAKDOWN is one of those lower-budgeted, under-the-radar type movies which pop up on late night television to hook and fascinate you. In essence, it's a B-movie with a better cast than usual; one of those films I saw and liked years and years ago and which has stayed with me ever since. I recently revisited the film on DVD and was surprised to discover that it's actually an excellent little action/mystery/thriller and one of my all-time favourites. The ever under-appreciated Kurt Russell stars as that classic archetype, the ordinary guy, who finds himself out of his depth when his wife goes missing after hitching a ride with a seemingly kindly trucker. I won't spoil what happens after that, only to saw that the screenplay is absolutely loaded with suspense. Truly, you could hear a pin drop as I sat watching this film, riveted to the screen; the bank scene is the real highlight, but the later antics pay off nicely too. Things culminate with a nicely directed action scene featuring some great car stunts. Much of the film's success comes from the casting of Russell, whose acting adds immeasurably to the experience. He's one of those instantly identifiable and likable actors who you end up rooting for from the outset, even in more conflicted roles like the one he played in corrupt cop yarn DARK BLUE. If only Tarantino's DEATH PROOF had been more like this movie! Instead, the directorial duties are handled by Jonathan Mostow, his debut picture, and he does a wonderful job. I equally enjoyed his follow-up films, U-571 and even TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, although I'll admit that SURROGATES was a little lacking in the substance stakes. J. T. Walsh also does a nice job in a supporting role, and it's fun to see M. C. Gainey given something larger than a cameo for a change.

    Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan play Jeff & Amy Taylor, who are traveling by car across country to California. After stopping at a gas station, they develop engine trouble in the middle of the desert. Desperate, his wife agrees to a ride with a friendly trucker(played memorably by J.T. Walsh), who promises to get them help. When she doesn't return(and after the car starts working again) Jeff drives back into town, only to find to his dismay that not only isn't his wife there, but that they never showed up at all. He does find the trucker, only to be shocked when told by him that he doesn't know what he's talking about! Thus begins a game of cat and mouse, hunter and hunted between Jeff and a particularly nasty gang of kidnappers, demanding ransom. Extremely exciting film involves the viewer with the couple's plight right away, and seldom goes wrong. Direction by Jonathan Mostow is efficient and inspired, and the performances really ring true, as does the smart script, leading to a cliffhanging climax. Cautionary tale about not going along with strangers works well as a variation on "Duel". Not to be missed.

    The always engaging screen veteran Kurt Russell and his real-life good friend, the late, great J.T. Walsh, make for entertaining adversaries in this relentlessly tense and lightning paced movie that delivers the thrills in a big way. It has basically realistic characters doing basically believable things, which puts "Breakdown" above other movies of its type. Kurt stars as Jeff Taylor, a man moving from Boston to San Diego with his wife Amy (Kathleen Quinlan). They've had some money problems and are hoping for a change in their fortunes. What happens is that their car breaks down in the country. Along comes a trucker named Red (Walsh) who offers to drive them to a place where they can phone for help. Jeff opts to stay with the car, and when he tries to hook up with Amy at the agreed rendezvous point, she's nowhere to be found. Jeff frantically tries to search for her, with little to no help from anybody, and ends up in some pretty hair raising episodes as he gets caught up in a plot hatched by some very bad guys. Kurt is fantastic as an ordinary guy who is forced to do some extraordinary things. He's not your standard movie hero who faces everything stoically and with a quip for every dangerous occasion; he's actually frightened and out of his depth but still determined to find his mate. Quinlan can't do much with a role that disappears from the story for a while, but she's as appealing as she's ever been. Walsh is perfect malevolent fun as a really evil bastard with an unsuspecting wife (Moira Sinise) and kid (Vincent Berry). Director Jonathan Mostow, who also co-wrote the screenplay based on his own story, has his movie hit the ground running and never stop moving. It emphasizes the isolation of the surroundings at every turn and keeps coming up with obstacles for its hero to overcome. It's also commendable in the way that it shows villains who have to change their modus operandi when their scheme doesn't work out as they wanted it to. There's also a chilling moment when Jeff is staring at a bulletin board littered with scores of posters of missing persons. "100,000 people go missing in this country every year," says a deputy, and we don't disbelieve him. Lots of wonderful scenery, and music by Basil Poledouris that matches the movies' pace, help a great deal, as well as a solid supporting cast including M.C. Gainey and Jack Noseworthy as two of the accomplices, Rex Linn as the level headed police chief, and Jack McGee as a cranky bartender. "Breakdown" is just pure entertainment that moves along to a rather brutal conclusion. It comes highly recommended to any fan of this genre. Eight out of 10.

    I started watching this movie thinking it would be one of those never ending races down the road, but happily, it was not. "Breakdown" begins with a couple facing problems with their car, when a trucker offers them a ride. Only the female accepts, whilst the male stays there to fix that. After that, he simply can't find her anymore. Of course there are a bunch of bandits behind this, and it is impressive to see how cold and mean they are. This great characterization of the gangster is due to great acting, along with a professional directing. Even thought I usually dislike movies involving kidnapping, mainly with action scenes, this one strongly entertained me, and 93 minutes just passed by in a minute. "Breakdown" leaves you in the edge of your seat, making you hate the villains very hard and cheer for the main couple, which makes it a GREAT film for all audiences.

The pacing and development of the story is first rate. One of the film's strengths is that you're never really sure who is a good guy and who's in on the act. I guess I could have done without some of the ridiculous actionman stuff in the latter stages. It would have been a better thriller if it concentrated on the psychological, which is sort of how it started. But overall you just can't stop watching it, and that's the hallmark of a good thriller.

    I just saw this movie again for the first time since it was released in '97 and it was just as scary now as ever before. I love the open road and enjoy long drives but after recently watching this movie again I may have to re think my love of the open highway! Yikes!! Kurt Russell is great in this film as the hapless husband who tries to rescue his wife from the group of crazies who are holding her for ransom. But without spoiling the plot, this movie does remind me of one of the other really scary rod trip movie Wolf Creek. Both movie have slightly similar overtones of nutty backwoods (or back roads) people who kidnap innocent passerbys. This movie held me to the edge of my seat due to the suspenseful plot. Check it out but be sure to lock your car doors and check the rear view mirror!

    It takes a lot for me to designate a thriller as utterly and completely mesmerizing, but such is the case with the 1997 Kurt Russell vehicle Breakdown. I stumbled upon this gem when it was released on VHS some 10+ years ago, and, as I recently browsed the somewhat deflated selection of films available in my "Watch Instantly" Netflix queue, decided to give it another go. Once again diving headlong into this ballet of desert highway carnage was like getting reacquainted with an old friend; consequently, this has caused me to lament the stale-by- comparison state of many recent "road rage thrillers" offered up by Hollywood. If you've never seen Breakdown, it could be described as a more intelligent version of Joy Ride (or, perhaps, The Hitcher). It's about a married couple named Jeff (Russell) and Amy (Quinlan) who are driving cross countryfrom Boston to San Diegoto take on more lucrative employment opportunities. Along the way, they almost collide with a local in a pick-up truck on a remote desert highway. When they stop at the next gas station, the fella driving the trucka black-clad hombre with a handlebar mustache and a cowboy hatproceeds to chew out Jeff for his idiotic behavior behind the wheel. The two eventually call a truce, part ways, and go about their lives. It's not long, however, before Jeff's brand new Jeep inexplicably breaks down. As the couple is trying to assess the situation, a man in an 18-wheeler stops, offers assistance, and eventually ends up suggesting the pair ride with him to the nearest town so they can call a tow truck. Jeff is leery about leaving his car on the side of a highway with a local lunatic on the prowl, so Amy hops in the semi, presumably to wait for her husband at a diner as he figures out what to do. Once she leaves, Jeff discovers the problem, fixes the car, and heads to the diner. When he gets there, though, Amy is nowhere to be found. The locals have no idea who she is, and they all claim to have never seen her. What ensues is a maddeningly wild goose chase across barren southwestern terrain as Jeff does everything in his power to find his spouse. There are twists and turns aplenty, and the action is great. The most disturbing thing about the film is how genuine it all seems. I have no trouble believing that something like this could (and perhaps has) occur in such remote locales, and there's a real sense of desperation to everything that's unfolding. Russell is great as the panicked husband who knows he's going to have to take things to the extreme to get his wife back, and almostalmostevery one of his decisions seems completely rational. The movie does give way to certain conventions from time to time, and I wish it would've built up the paranoia just a little longer before the "big reveal" occurs (a la Arlington Road), but there's no denying the intensity on display here. That being said, who's ready for a road trip?

    I expected more from this film. It starts out promisingly. One could believe that a strangely hostile redneck from some unidentifiable place out West might be resentful of airbrushed yuppies who stray into his territory from Massachusetts. Early on, the film succeeds in creating a squirmy sense of claustrophobic danger. But then it degenerates into boilerplate cat-and-mouse stuff when you see the bad guys are only after cash. For the most part, the characterization also failed to satisfy. Kurt Russell starts out looking wimpy against the sinister provocation of M.C. Gainey's Earl. But he winds up engaging in all kinds of acrobatic derring-do, scrambling over rooftops and hanging onto truck undercarriages, and it's just not credible. We're told nothing about Jeff's background but somehow I doubt these talents. Kathleen Quinlan did OK in the nothing role of Jeff's wife and J.T. Walsh was pretty effective as a two-faced kidnapper. I was saddened to read on Wikipedia that he died a year after this film was released, at age 53, during a stay at a cleansing-type retreat. In all this was disappointing but I'm not sorry I saw it.

As the couple is trying to assess the situation, a man in an 18-wheeler stops, offers assistance, and eventually ends up suggesting the pair ride with him to the nearest town so they can call a tow truck. Jeff is leery about leaving his car on the side of a highway with a local lunatic on the prowl, so Amy hops in the semi, presumably to wait for her husband at a diner as he figures out what to do. Once she leaves, Jeff discovers the problem, fixes the car, and heads to the diner. When he gets there, though, Amy is nowhere to be found. The locals have no idea who she is, and they all claim to have never seen her. What ensues is a maddeningly wild goose chase across barren southwestern terrain as Jeff does everything in his power to find his spouse. There are twists and turns aplenty, and the action is great. The most disturbing thing about the film is how genuine it all seems. I have no trouble believing that something like this could (and perhaps has) occur in such remote locales, and there's a real sense of desperation to everything that's unfolding. Russell is great as the panicked husband who knows he's going to have to take things to the extreme to get his wife back, and almostalmostevery one of his decisions seems completely rational. The movie does give way to certain conventions from time to time, and I wish it would've built up the paranoia just a little longer before the "big reveal" occurs (a la Arlington Road), but there's no denying the intensity on display here. That being said, who's ready for a road trip?

    I expected more from this film. It starts out promisingly. One could believe that a strangely hostile redneck from some unidentifiable place out West might be resentful of airbrushed yuppies who stray into his territory from Massachusetts. Early on, the film succeeds in creating a squirmy sense of claustrophobic danger. But then it degenerates into boilerplate cat-and-mouse stuff when you see the bad guys are only after cash. For the most part, the characterization also failed to satisfy. Kurt Russell starts out looking wimpy against the sinister provocation of M.C. Gainey's Earl. But he winds up engaging in all kinds of acrobatic derring-do, scrambling over rooftops and hanging onto truck undercarriages, and it's just not credible. We're told nothing about Jeff's background but somehow I doubt these talents. Kathleen Quinlan did OK in the nothing role of Jeff's wife and J.T. Walsh was pretty effective as a two-faced kidnapper. I was saddened to read on Wikipedia that he died a year after this film was released, at age 53, during a stay at a cleansing-type retreat. In all this was disappointing but I'm not sorry I saw it.

    This movie is a combination of Duel and Joy Ride and I think it works out to be greater then either of them. It seems people are scared of truckers because so many movies come out where the truckers are these bad people. The acting was great and the story line was thrilling and intense. This movie is about a man and his wife who are travelling through the desert on the way to their new home. Their car breaks down on the way and a trucker stops and picks up his wife so she can go to the nearest phone and call a tow truck. But when the husband gets his car started as goes to where they were supposed to meet he finds out she never arrived and the hunt for his wife begins. This movie is probably the best of these trucker thriller movies for sure. And whats more its probably Kurt Russels best movie even though his acting got a bit shaky in the more emotional scenes.

    Boy, do I have quite the story on my search for this movie. I first saw this on late night television around 2000 when I was about 14. I loved the movie, but I didn't know what the title was and my parents didn't have cable or a TV guide. So I took it in my own hands to find the movie, no matter how long it took or how I got it. I searched every video store in my town. And I mean everything. Every blockbuster, Hollywood Video, every back section of a grocery store, everything. After five unsuccessful years of searching, I gave up. But two years later, in 2007, I got back into it. Nothing again for two years. So after giving up on that, I decided to use Yahoo Answers. I finally got it.... after three tries. To be finished at a later date.

    BREAKDOWN is one of those lower-budgeted, under-the-radar type movies which pop up on late night television to hook and fascinate you. In essence, it's a B-movie with a better cast than usual; one of those films I saw and liked years and years ago and which has stayed with me ever since. I recently revisited the film on DVD and was surprised to discover that it's actually an excellent little action/mystery/thriller and one of my all-time favourites. The ever under-appreciated Kurt Russell stars as that classic archetype, the ordinary guy, who finds himself out of his depth when his wife goes missing after hitching a ride with a seemingly kindly trucker. I won't spoil what happens after that, only to saw that the screenplay is absolutely loaded with suspense. Truly, you could hear a pin drop as I sat watching this film, riveted to the screen; the bank scene is the real highlight, but the later antics pay off nicely too. Things culminate with a nicely directed action scene featuring some great car stunts. Much of the film's success comes from the casting of Russell, whose acting adds immeasurably to the experience. He's one of those instantly identifiable and likable actors who you end up rooting for from the outset, even in more conflicted roles like the one he played in corrupt cop yarn DARK BLUE. If only Tarantino's DEATH PROOF had been more like this movie! Instead, the directorial duties are handled by Jonathan Mostow, his debut picture, and he does a wonderful job. I equally enjoyed his follow-up films, U-571 and even TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, although I'll admit that SURROGATES was a little lacking in the substance stakes. J. T. Walsh also does a nice job in a supporting role, and it's fun to see M. C. Gainey given something larger than a cameo for a change.

    Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan play Jeff & Amy Taylor, who are traveling by car across country to California. After stopping at a gas station, they develop engine trouble in the middle of the desert. Desperate, his wife agrees to a ride with a friendly trucker(played memorably by J.T. Walsh), who promises to get them help. When she doesn't return(and after the car starts working again) Jeff drives back into town, only to find to his dismay that not only isn't his wife there, but that they never showed up at all. He does find the trucker, only to be shocked when told by him that he doesn't know what he's talking about! Thus begins a game of cat and mouse, hunter and hunted between Jeff and a particularly nasty gang of kidnappers, demanding ransom. Extremely exciting film involves the viewer with the couple's plight right away, and seldom goes wrong. Direction by Jonathan Mostow is efficient and inspired, and the performances really ring true, as does the smart script, leading to a cliffhanging climax. Cautionary tale about not going along with strangers works well as a variation on "Duel". Not to be missed.

    The always engaging screen veteran Kurt Russell and his real-life good friend, the late, great J.T. Walsh, make for entertaining adversaries in this relentlessly tense and lightning paced movie that delivers the thrills in a big way. It has basically realistic characters doing basically believable things, which puts "Breakdown" above other movies of its type. Kurt stars as Jeff Taylor, a man moving from Boston to San Diego with his wife Amy (Kathleen Quinlan). They've had some money problems and are hoping for a change in their fortunes. What happens is that their car breaks down in the country. Along comes a trucker named Red (Walsh) who offers to drive them to a place where they can phone for help. Jeff opts to stay with the car, and when he tries to hook up with Amy at the agreed rendezvous point, she's nowhere to be found. Jeff frantically tries to search for her, with little to no help from anybody, and ends up in some pretty hair raising episodes as he gets caught up in a plot hatched by some very bad guys. Kurt is fantastic as an ordinary guy who is forced to do some extraordinary things. He's not your standard movie hero who faces everything stoically and with a quip for every dangerous occasion; he's actually frightened and out of his depth but still determined to find his mate. Quinlan can't do much with a role that disappears from the story for a while, but she's as appealing as she's ever been. Walsh is perfect malevolent fun as a really evil bastard with an unsuspecting wife (Moira Sinise) and kid (Vincent Berry). Director Jonathan Mostow, who also co-wrote the screenplay based on his own story, has his movie hit the ground running and never stop moving. It emphasizes the isolation of the surroundings at every turn and keeps coming up with obstacles for its hero to overcome. It's also commendable in the way that it shows villains who have to change their modus operandi when their scheme doesn't work out as they wanted it to. There's also a chilling moment when Jeff is staring at a bulletin board littered with scores of posters of missing persons. "100,000 people go missing in this country every year," says a deputy, and we don't disbelieve him. Lots of wonderful scenery, and music by Basil Poledouris that matches the movies' pace, help a great deal, as well as a solid supporting cast including M.C. Gainey and Jack Noseworthy as two of the accomplices, Rex Linn as the level headed police chief, and Jack McGee as a cranky bartender. "Breakdown" is just pure entertainment that moves along to a rather brutal conclusion. It comes highly recommended to any fan of this genre. Eight out of 10.

    I started watching this movie thinking it would be one of those never ending races down the road, but happily, it was not. "Breakdown" begins with a couple facing problems with their car, when a trucker offers them a ride. Only the female accepts, whilst the male stays there to fix that. After that, he simply can't find her anymore. Of course there are a bunch of bandits behind this, and it is impressive to see how cold and mean they are. This great characterization of the gangster is due to great acting, along with a professional directing. Even thought I usually dislike movies involving kidnapping, mainly with action scenes, this one strongly entertained me, and 93 minutes just passed by in a minute. "Breakdown" leaves you in the edge of your seat, making you hate the villains very hard and cheer for the main couple, which makes it a GREAT film for all audiences.

Step forward and take a bow, Jonathan Mostow and Basil Poledouris. Apparently this is the second score, as the first one was rejected. Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as Amy Taylor and Kurt Russell as husband Jeff. But really there isn't a weak point in the cast. The cinematography is excellent. The pacing and development of the story is first rate. One of the film's strengths is that you're never really sure who is a good guy and who's in on the act. I guess I could have done without some of the ridiculous actionman stuff in the latter stages. It would have been a better thriller if it concentrated on the psychological, which is sort of how it started. But overall you just can't stop watching it, and that's the hallmark of a good thriller. Nine out of ten.

    I just saw this movie again for the first time since it was released in '97 and it was just as scary now as ever before. I love the open road and enjoy long drives but after recently watching this movie again I may have to re think my love of the open highway! Yikes!! Kurt Russell is great in this film as the hapless husband who tries to rescue his wife from the group of crazies who are holding her for ransom. But without spoiling the plot, this movie does remind me of one of the other really scary rod trip movie Wolf Creek. Both movie have slightly similar overtones of nutty backwoods (or back roads) people who kidnap innocent passerbys. This movie held me to the edge of my seat due to the suspenseful plot. Check it out but be sure to lock your car doors and check the rear view mirror!

    It takes a lot for me to designate a thriller as utterly and completely mesmerizing, but such is the case with the 1997 Kurt Russell vehicle Breakdown. I stumbled upon this gem when it was released on VHS some 10+ years ago, and, as I recently browsed the somewhat deflated selection of films available in my "Watch Instantly" Netflix queue, decided to give it another go. Once again diving headlong into this ballet of desert highway carnage was like getting reacquainted with an old friend; consequently, this has caused me to lament the stale-by- comparison state of many recent "road rage thrillers" offered up by Hollywood. If you've never seen Breakdown, it could be described as a more intelligent version of Joy Ride (or, perhaps, The Hitcher). It's about a married couple named Jeff (Russell) and Amy (Quinlan) who are driving cross countryfrom Boston to San Diegoto take on more lucrative employment opportunities. Along the way, they almost collide with a local in a pick-up truck on a remote desert highway. When they stop at the next gas station, the fella driving the trucka black-clad hombre with a handlebar mustache and a cowboy hatproceeds to chew out Jeff for his idiotic behavior behind the wheel. The two eventually call a truce, part ways, and go about their lives. It's not long, however, before Jeff's brand new Jeep inexplicably breaks down. As the couple is trying to assess the situation, a man in an 18-wheeler stops, offers assistance, and eventually ends up suggesting the pair ride with him to the nearest town so they can call a tow truck. Jeff is leery about leaving his car on the side of a highway with a local lunatic on the prowl, so Amy hops in the semi, presumably to wait for her husband at a diner as he figures out what to do. Once she leaves, Jeff discovers the problem, fixes the car, and heads to the diner. When he gets there, though, Amy is nowhere to be found. The locals have no idea who she is, and they all claim to have never seen her. What ensues is a maddeningly wild goose chase across barren southwestern terrain as Jeff does everything in his power to find his spouse. There are twists and turns aplenty, and the action is great. The most disturbing thing about the film is how genuine it all seems. I have no trouble believing that something like this could (and perhaps has) occur in such remote locales, and there's a real sense of desperation to everything that's unfolding. Russell is great as the panicked husband who knows he's going to have to take things to the extreme to get his wife back, and almostalmostevery one of his decisions seems completely rational. The movie does give way to certain conventions from time to time, and I wish it would've built up the paranoia just a little longer before the "big reveal" occurs (a la Arlington Road), but there's no denying the intensity on display here. That being said, who's ready for a road trip?

    I expected more from this film. It starts out promisingly. One could believe that a strangely hostile redneck from some unidentifiable place out West might be resentful of airbrushed yuppies who stray into his territory from Massachusetts. Early on, the film succeeds in creating a squirmy sense of claustrophobic danger. But then it degenerates into boilerplate cat-and-mouse stuff when you see the bad guys are only after cash. For the most part, the characterization also failed to satisfy. Kurt Russell starts out looking wimpy against the sinister provocation of M.C. Gainey's Earl. But he winds up engaging in all kinds of acrobatic derring-do, scrambling over rooftops and hanging onto truck undercarriages, and it's just not credible. We're told nothing about Jeff's background but somehow I doubt these talents. Kathleen Quinlan did OK in the nothing role of Jeff's wife and J.T. Walsh was pretty effective as a two-faced kidnapper. I was saddened to read on Wikipedia that he died a year after this film was released, at age 53, during a stay at a cleansing-type retreat. In all this was disappointing but I'm not sorry I saw it.

Both movie have slightly similar overtones of nutty backwoods (or back roads) people who kidnap innocent passerbys. This movie held me to the edge of my seat due to the suspenseful plot. Check it out but be sure to lock your car doors and check the rear view mirror!

    It takes a lot for me to designate a thriller as utterly and completely mesmerizing, but such is the case with the 1997 Kurt Russell vehicle Breakdown. I stumbled upon this gem when it was released on VHS some 10+ years ago, and, as I recently browsed the somewhat deflated selection of films available in my "Watch Instantly" Netflix queue, decided to give it another go. Once again diving headlong into this ballet of desert highway carnage was like getting reacquainted with an old friend; consequently, this has caused me to lament the stale-by- comparison state of many recent "road rage thrillers" offered up by Hollywood. If you've never seen Breakdown, it could be described as a more intelligent version of Joy Ride (or, perhaps, The Hitcher). It's about a married couple named Jeff (Russell) and Amy (Quinlan) who are driving cross countryfrom Boston to San Diegoto take on more lucrative employment opportunities. Along the way, they almost collide with a local in a pick-up truck on a remote desert highway. When they stop at the next gas station, the fella driving the trucka black-clad hombre with a handlebar mustache and a cowboy hatproceeds to chew out Jeff for his idiotic behavior behind the wheel. The two eventually call a truce, part ways, and go about their lives. It's not long, however, before Jeff's brand new Jeep inexplicably breaks down. As the couple is trying to assess the situation, a man in an 18-wheeler stops, offers assistance, and eventually ends up suggesting the pair ride with him to the nearest town so they can call a tow truck. Jeff is leery about leaving his car on the side of a highway with a local lunatic on the prowl, so Amy hops in the semi, presumably to wait for her husband at a diner as he figures out what to do. Once she leaves, Jeff discovers the problem, fixes the car, and heads to the diner. When he gets there, though, Amy is nowhere to be found. The locals have no idea who she is, and they all claim to have never seen her. What ensues is a maddeningly wild goose chase across barren southwestern terrain as Jeff does everything in his power to find his spouse. There are twists and turns aplenty, and the action is great. The most disturbing thing about the film is how genuine it all seems. I have no trouble believing that something like this could (and perhaps has) occur in such remote locales, and there's a real sense of desperation to everything that's unfolding. Russell is great as the panicked husband who knows he's going to have to take things to the extreme to get his wife back, and almostalmostevery one of his decisions seems completely rational. The movie does give way to certain conventions from time to time, and I wish it would've built up the paranoia just a little longer before the "big reveal" occurs (a la Arlington Road), but there's no denying the intensity on display here. That being said, who's ready for a road trip?

    I expected more from this film. It starts out promisingly. One could believe that a strangely hostile redneck from some unidentifiable place out West might be resentful of airbrushed yuppies who stray into his territory from Massachusetts. Early on, the film succeeds in creating a squirmy sense of claustrophobic danger. But then it degenerates into boilerplate cat-and-mouse stuff when you see the bad guys are only after cash. For the most part, the characterization also failed to satisfy. Kurt Russell starts out looking wimpy against the sinister provocation of M.C. Gainey's Earl. But he winds up engaging in all kinds of acrobatic derring-do, scrambling over rooftops and hanging onto truck undercarriages, and it's just not credible. We're told nothing about Jeff's background but somehow I doubt these talents. Kathleen Quinlan did OK in the nothing role of Jeff's wife and J.T. Walsh was pretty effective as a two-faced kidnapper. I was saddened to read on Wikipedia that he died a year after this film was released, at age 53, during a stay at a cleansing-type retreat. In all this was disappointing but I'm not sorry I saw it.

    This movie is a combination of Duel and Joy Ride and I think it works out to be greater then either of them. It seems people are scared of truckers because so many movies come out where the truckers are these bad people. The acting was great and the story line was thrilling and intense. This movie is about a man and his wife who are travelling through the desert on the way to their new home. Their car breaks down on the way and a trucker stops and picks up his wife so she can go to the nearest phone and call a tow truck. But when the husband gets his car started as goes to where they were supposed to meet he finds out she never arrived and the hunt for his wife begins. This movie is probably the best of these trucker thriller movies for sure. And whats more its probably Kurt Russels best movie even though his acting got a bit shaky in the more emotional scenes.

    Boy, do I have quite the story on my search for this movie. I first saw this on late night television around 2000 when I was about 14. I loved the movie, but I didn't know what the title was and my parents didn't have cable or a TV guide. So I took it in my own hands to find the movie, no matter how long it took or how I got it. I searched every video store in my town. And I mean everything. Every blockbuster, Hollywood Video, every back section of a grocery store, everything. After five unsuccessful years of searching, I gave up. But two years later, in 2007, I got back into it. Nothing again for two years. So after giving up on that, I decided to use Yahoo Answers. I finally got it.... after three tries. To be finished at a later date.

    BREAKDOWN is one of those lower-budgeted, under-the-radar type movies which pop up on late night television to hook and fascinate you. In essence, it's a B-movie with a better cast than usual; one of those films I saw and liked years and years ago and which has stayed with me ever since. I recently revisited the film on DVD and was surprised to discover that it's actually an excellent little action/mystery/thriller and one of my all-time favourites. The ever under-appreciated Kurt Russell stars as that classic archetype, the ordinary guy, who finds himself out of his depth when his wife goes missing after hitching a ride with a seemingly kindly trucker. I won't spoil what happens after that, only to saw that the screenplay is absolutely loaded with suspense. Truly, you could hear a pin drop as I sat watching this film, riveted to the screen; the bank scene is the real highlight, but the later antics pay off nicely too. Things culminate with a nicely directed action scene featuring some great car stunts. Much of the film's success comes from the casting of Russell, whose acting adds immeasurably to the experience. He's one of those instantly identifiable and likable actors who you end up rooting for from the outset, even in more conflicted roles like the one he played in corrupt cop yarn DARK BLUE. If only Tarantino's DEATH PROOF had been more like this movie! Instead, the directorial duties are handled by Jonathan Mostow, his debut picture, and he does a wonderful job. I equally enjoyed his follow-up films, U-571 and even TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, although I'll admit that SURROGATES was a little lacking in the substance stakes. J. T. Walsh also does a nice job in a supporting role, and it's fun to see M. C. Gainey given something larger than a cameo for a change.

    Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan play Jeff & Amy Taylor, who are traveling by car across country to California. After stopping at a gas station, they develop engine trouble in the middle of the desert. Desperate, his wife agrees to a ride with a friendly trucker(played memorably by J.T. Walsh), who promises to get them help. When she doesn't return(and after the car starts working again) Jeff drives back into town, only to find to his dismay that not only isn't his wife there, but that they never showed up at all. He does find the trucker, only to be shocked when told by him that he doesn't know what he's talking about! Thus begins a game of cat and mouse, hunter and hunted between Jeff and a particularly nasty gang of kidnappers, demanding ransom. Extremely exciting film involves the viewer with the couple's plight right away, and seldom goes wrong. Direction by Jonathan Mostow is efficient and inspired, and the performances really ring true, as does the smart script, leading to a cliffhanging climax. Cautionary tale about not going along with strangers works well as a variation on "Duel". Not to be missed.

    The always engaging screen veteran Kurt Russell and his real-life good friend, the late, great J.T. Walsh, make for entertaining adversaries in this relentlessly tense and lightning paced movie that delivers the thrills in a big way. It has basically realistic characters doing basically believable things, which puts "Breakdown" above other movies of its type. Kurt stars as Jeff Taylor, a man moving from Boston to San Diego with his wife Amy (Kathleen Quinlan). They've had some money problems and are hoping for a change in their fortunes. What happens is that their car breaks down in the country. Along comes a trucker named Red (Walsh) who offers to drive them to a place where they can phone for help. Jeff opts to stay with the car, and when he tries to hook up with Amy at the agreed rendezvous point, she's nowhere to be found. Jeff frantically tries to search for her, with little to no help from anybody, and ends up in some pretty hair raising episodes as he gets caught up in a plot hatched by some very bad guys. Kurt is fantastic as an ordinary guy who is forced to do some extraordinary things. He's not your standard movie hero who faces everything stoically and with a quip for every dangerous occasion; he's actually frightened and out of his depth but still determined to find his mate. Quinlan can't do much with a role that disappears from the story for a while, but she's as appealing as she's ever been. Walsh is perfect malevolent fun as a really evil bastard with an unsuspecting wife (Moira Sinise) and kid (Vincent Berry). Director Jonathan Mostow, who also co-wrote the screenplay based on his own story, has his movie hit the ground running and never stop moving. It emphasizes the isolation of the surroundings at every turn and keeps coming up with obstacles for its hero to overcome. It's also commendable in the way that it shows villains who have to change their modus operandi when their scheme doesn't work out as they wanted it to. There's also a chilling moment when Jeff is staring at a bulletin board littered with scores of posters of missing persons. "100,000 people go missing in this country every year," says a deputy, and we don't disbelieve him. Lots of wonderful scenery, and music by Basil Poledouris that matches the movies' pace, help a great deal, as well as a solid supporting cast including M.C. Gainey and Jack Noseworthy as two of the accomplices, Rex Linn as the level headed police chief, and Jack McGee as a cranky bartender. "Breakdown" is just pure entertainment that moves along to a rather brutal conclusion. It comes highly recommended to any fan of this genre. Eight out of 10.

    I started watching this movie thinking it would be one of those never ending races down the road, but happily, it was not. "Breakdown" begins with a couple facing problems with their car, when a trucker offers them a ride. Only the female accepts, whilst the male stays there to fix that. After that, he simply can't find her anymore. Of course there are a bunch of bandits behind this, and it is impressive to see how cold and mean they are. This great characterization of the gangster is due to great acting, along with a professional directing. Even thought I usually dislike movies involving kidnapping, mainly with action scenes, this one strongly entertained me, and 93 minutes just passed by in a minute. "Breakdown" leaves you in the edge of your seat, making you hate the villains very hard and cheer for the main couple, which makes it a GREAT film for all audiences.

    This is a really brilliant film. From the opening scene, and the overlying music, this gives the appearance of being made by someone who knows what they're doing. Step forward and take a bow, Jonathan Mostow and Basil Poledouris. Apparently this is the second score, as the first one was rejected. Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as Amy Taylor and Kurt Russell as husband Jeff. But really there isn't a weak point in the cast. The cinematography is excellent. The pacing and development of the story is first rate. One of the film's strengths is that you're never really sure who is a good guy and who's in on the act. I guess I could have done without some of the ridiculous actionman stuff in the latter stages. It would have been a better thriller if it concentrated on the psychological, which is sort of how it started. But overall you just can't stop watching it, and that's the hallmark of a good thriller. Nine out of ten.

    I just saw this movie again for the first time since it was released in '97 and it was just as scary now as ever before. I love the open road and enjoy long drives but after recently watching this movie again I may have to re think my love of the open highway! Yikes!! Kurt Russell is great in this film as the hapless husband who tries to rescue his wife from the group of crazies who are holding her for ransom. But without spoiling the plot, this movie does remind me of one of the other really scary rod trip movie Wolf Creek. Both movie have slightly similar overtones of nutty backwoods (or back roads) people who kidnap innocent passerbys. This movie held me to the edge of my seat due to the suspenseful plot. Check it out but be sure to lock your car doors and check the rear view mirror!

    This is a really brilliant film. From the opening scene, and the overlying music, this gives the appearance of being made by someone who knows what they're doing. Step forward and take a bow, Jonathan Mostow and Basil Poledouris. Apparently this is the second score, as the first one was rejected. Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as Amy Taylor and Kurt Russell as husband Jeff. But really there isn't a weak point in the cast. The cinematography is excellent. The pacing and development of the story is first rate. One of the film's strengths is that you're never really sure who is a good guy and who's in on the act. I guess I could have done without some of the ridiculous actionman stuff in the latter stages. It would have been a better thriller if it concentrated on the psychological, which is sort of how it started. But overall you just can't stop watching it, and that's the hallmark of a good thriller. Nine out of ten.

    I just saw this movie again for the first time since it was released in '97 and it was just as scary now as ever before. I love the open road and enjoy long drives but after recently watching this movie again I may have to re think my love of the open highway! Yikes!! Kurt Russell is great in this film as the hapless husband who tries to rescue his wife from the group of crazies who are holding her for ransom. But without spoiling the plot, this movie does remind me of one of the other really scary rod trip movie Wolf Creek. Both movie have slightly similar overtones of nutty backwoods (or back roads) people who kidnap innocent passerbys. This movie held me to the edge of my seat due to the suspenseful plot. Check it out but be sure to lock your car doors and check the rear view mirror!

    It takes a lot for me to designate a thriller as utterly and completely mesmerizing, but such is the case with the 1997 Kurt Russell vehicle Breakdown. I stumbled upon this gem when it was released on VHS some 10+ years ago, and, as I recently browsed the somewhat deflated selection of films available in my "Watch Instantly" Netflix queue, decided to give it another go. Once again diving headlong into this ballet of desert highway carnage was like getting reacquainted with an old friend; consequently, this has caused me to lament the stale-by- comparison state of many recent "road rage thrillers" offered up by Hollywood. If you've never seen Breakdown, it could be described as a more intelligent version of Joy Ride (or, perhaps, The Hitcher). It's about a married couple named Jeff (Russell) and Amy (Quinlan) who are driving cross countryfrom Boston to San Diegoto take on more lucrative employment opportunities. Along the way, they almost collide with a local in a pick-up truck on a remote desert highway. When they stop at the next gas station, the fella driving the trucka black-clad hombre with a handlebar mustache and a cowboy hatproceeds to chew out Jeff for his idiotic behavior behind the wheel. The two eventually call a truce, part ways, and go about their lives. It's not long, however, before Jeff's brand new Jeep inexplicably breaks down. As the couple is trying to assess the situation, a man in an 18-wheeler stops, offers assistance, and eventually ends up suggesting the pair ride with him to the nearest town so they can call a tow truck. Jeff is leery about leaving his car on the side of a highway with a local lunatic on the prowl, so Amy hops in the semi, presumably to wait for her husband at a diner as he figures out what to do. Once she leaves, Jeff discovers the problem, fixes the car, and heads to the diner. When he gets there, though, Amy is nowhere to be found. The locals have no idea who she is, and they all claim to have never seen her. What ensues is a maddeningly wild goose chase across barren southwestern terrain as Jeff does everything in his power to find his spouse. There are twists and turns aplenty, and the action is great. The most disturbing thing about the film is how genuine it all seems. I have no trouble believing that something like this could (and perhaps has) occur in such remote locales, and there's a real sense of desperation to everything that's unfolding. Russell is great as the panicked husband who knows he's going to have to take things to the extreme to get his wife back, and almostalmostevery one of his decisions seems completely rational. The movie does give way to certain conventions from time to time, and I wish it would've built up the paranoia just a little longer before the "big reveal" occurs (a la Arlington Road), but there's no denying the intensity on display here. That being said, who's ready for a road trip?

    I expected more from this film. It starts out promisingly. One could believe that a strangely hostile redneck from some unidentifiable place out West might be resentful of airbrushed yuppies who stray into his territory from Massachusetts. Early on, the film succeeds in creating a squirmy sense of claustrophobic danger. But then it degenerates into boilerplate cat-and-mouse stuff when you see the bad guys are only after cash. For the most part, the characterization also failed to satisfy. Kurt Russell starts out looking wimpy against the sinister provocation of M.C. Gainey's Earl. But he winds up engaging in all kinds of acrobatic derring-do, scrambling over rooftops and hanging onto truck undercarriages, and it's just not credible. We're told nothing about Jeff's background but somehow I doubt these talents. Kathleen Quinlan did OK in the nothing role of Jeff's wife and J.T. Walsh was pretty effective as a two-faced kidnapper. I was saddened to read on Wikipedia that he died a year after this film was released, at age 53, during a stay at a cleansing-type retreat. In all this was disappointing but I'm not sorry I saw it.

    This movie is a combination of Duel and Joy Ride and I think it works out to be greater then either of them. It seems people are scared of truckers because so many movies come out where the truckers are these bad people. The acting was great and the story line was thrilling and intense. This movie is about a man and his wife who are travelling through the desert on the way to their new home. Their car breaks down on the way and a trucker stops and picks up his wife so she can go to the nearest phone and call a tow truck. But when the husband gets his car started as goes to where they were supposed to meet he finds out she never arrived and the hunt for his wife begins. This movie is probably the best of these trucker thriller movies for sure. And whats more its probably Kurt Russels best movie even though his acting got a bit shaky in the more emotional scenes.

    Boy, do I have quite the story on my search for this movie. I first saw this on late night television around 2000 when I was about 14. I loved the movie, but I didn't know what the title was and my parents didn't have cable or a TV guide. So I took it in my own hands to find the movie, no matter how long it took or how I got it. I searched every video store in my town. And I mean everything. Every blockbuster, Hollywood Video, every back section of a grocery store, everything. After five unsuccessful years of searching, I gave up. But two years later, in 2007, I got back into it. Nothing again for two years. So after giving up on that, I decided to use Yahoo Answers. I finally got it.... after three tries. To be finished at a later date.

    BREAKDOWN is one of those lower-budgeted, under-the-radar type movies which pop up on late night television to hook and fascinate you. In essence, it's a B-movie with a better cast than usual; one of those films I saw and liked years and years ago and which has stayed with me ever since. I recently revisited the film on DVD and was surprised to discover that it's actually an excellent little action/mystery/thriller and one of my all-time favourites. The ever under-appreciated Kurt Russell stars as that classic archetype, the ordinary guy, who finds himself out of his depth when his wife goes missing after hitching a ride with a seemingly kindly trucker. I won't spoil what happens after that, only to saw that the screenplay is absolutely loaded with suspense. Truly, you could hear a pin drop as I sat watching this film, riveted to the screen; the bank scene is the real highlight, but the later antics pay off nicely too. Things culminate with a nicely directed action scene featuring some great car stunts. Much of the film's success comes from the casting of Russell, whose acting adds immeasurably to the experience. He's one of those instantly identifiable and likable actors who you end up rooting for from the outset, even in more conflicted roles like the one he played in corrupt cop yarn DARK BLUE. If only Tarantino's DEATH PROOF had been more like this movie! Instead, the directorial duties are handled by Jonathan Mostow, his debut picture, and he does a wonderful job. I equally enjoyed his follow-up films, U-571 and even TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, although I'll admit that SURROGATES was a little lacking in the substance stakes. J. T. Walsh also does a nice job in a supporting role, and it's fun to see M. C. Gainey given something larger than a cameo for a change.
