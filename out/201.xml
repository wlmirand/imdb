 <sinopse>
  The lone survivor of an onslaught of flesh-possessing spirits holds up in a cabin with a group of strangers while the demons continue their attack.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A young man, named Ash, takes his girlfriend Linda to a secluded cabin in the woods where he plays back a professor's tape recorded recitation of passages from the Book of the Dead. The spell calls up an evil force from the woods which turns Linda into a monstrous Deadite, and threatens to do the same to Ash. When the professor's daughter and her entourage show up at the cabin, the night turns into a non-stop, grotesquely comic battle with chainsaw and shotgun on one side, demon horde and flying eyeball on the other.

    Evil Dead II (1987): The Good, the Bad and the Heroic Synopsis: Classic "go to abandoned cabin in the woods and bad things happen" style of movie starring Bruce Campbell, who reprises his role as Ash Williams. Technically more of a reboot than a sequel, the movie follows Ash and his love interest back to the little cabin in the woods where another reading from "The Book of the Dead" makes things rather interesting for its new inhabitants. The Good: Honestly, if you can't watch this movie and have a freakin' blast doing so.... I don't know what is wrong with you. For starters, don't take yourself or the movie so seriously... life, and this movie, are better that way. Raimi takes the concept of the original film and sort of reboots it (which can be a little confusing upon first view). It's basically the original Evil Dead on steroids. The result is a MORE over-the-top version of the original where Ash is now solely in control of the screen time, which is a marvelous thing. It's almost like Raimi and his writers are sitting in a room thinking, "How much ridiculously awesome stuff can we throw on the screen? Okay, yeah... let's do all of this!". It's brilliant. He leaves nothing on the table and the result is a wild, wacky movie with a frenetic pace. You just have no idea where he is going to take you next and it's a hoot. Also, the fact that he centers the movie around Bruce Campbell was a wise decision and ultimately makes it comparable to the original. If a different casting decision is made, this one is likely forgotten and Army of Darkness never happens. The Bad: Well, the fact that it's basically a retelling of the original story (or maybe "re-imagined" is a better way of saying it) is a cop out of sorts. Most would think a sequel (thus the name of "Evil Dead II") would pick up where we all left off. But no, Raimi instead revisits old stomping grounds. If he had failed to come up with new ideas, this would be a big problem, but thankfully, the acting of Campbell and the wild imagination of Raimi save this movie and honestly, make it very comparable in quality to the original - which from me, is high praise for the sequel. Some of the effects are tad out of date, sure... but the fact that the film is a little more black comedy versus straight-up horror helps the film date a little better. The characters not named "Ash" are pretty boring as well. Or maybe it is just that they are overshadowed by Campbell's performance. Either way, this tends to bog down the later parts of the movie a bit. The Heroic: Speaking of Campbell's performance... it is one of the all-time greats. In a vacuum of performances, Campbell's is truly Oscar-worthy, which many might think is a ridiculous thought. Still, I can't think of a single other "A-lister" that could do what he did and bring more value within the confines of what this movie is. In fact, Bruce Campbell IS the movie! Watching him slowly go insane is one of cinema's true pleasures. Campbell lays it all on the line and not for a minute does he disappoint. His catapult to cult status is no coincidence. It was well earned.

    Just finished watching Evil Dead II and it certainly delivers the goods! I found this sequel very entertaining, funny and original, but at the same time a bit less scary and disturbing than the first one. There are a lot of memorable scenes where crazy stuff happens to poor Ash, who had already suffered a lot in the first film. Speaking of which, Bruce Campbell is totally insane here and I appreciated his over the top performance, making his character much more interesting this time. Also, the practical effects are more polished and improved. Maybe it's just me, but I actually found the ones used in the The Evil Dead I more effective. I can't really say which one is my favorite so far since they are very distinct from each other and are both great. Now I will be heading to Army of Darkness, which appears to be one hell of a ride too.

    While Sam Raimi did base the first Evil Dead movie on his short movie "Within the woods" (a short a lot of people would love to see someday, but there are some issues with it, either rights issues or the material is not good enough, I guess), this is a sequel/remake of the first one. It seems like he was ahead of his time. We do get a "previously on Evil Dead" segment in the beginning, but it doesn't show the events that unfold as they were portrayed in the previous movie. It's like a short movie that changes the back-story a little bit. It also is a bit funnier than the first movie. Bruce Campbell is more than able to squeeze funny out of some situations. So while it seems like more of the same it is still more than entertaining.

    Evil Dead 2 has been my favorite movie for a long time now, but recently I started to think it may not be as great as I remember it from 6 months ago. So I gave it a re-watch to see if it still holds up. The movies plot is very simple, people trapped in a cabin while demons attack them, seams simple enough, but the crazy stuff that the demons do to the people make this movie immensely entertaining. The hero of the movie is Ash, and he's already survived the first Evil Dead and now he's the only survivor. but later on the owners of the cabin return to it and then they all need to fight to stay alive. The movies writing felt very natural in the way the people talked and interacted with another, but that doesn't mean it's without it's campy one-liners. The campy one- liners are all memorable and don't hold the movie back, if anything it helps the movie. Now the main thing about the movie that holds your attention is that you have no idea whats going to be thrown at our protagonist next. It could be trees attacking the cabin, your own hand getting possessed, or an eye popping out of a skull and into someones mouth, all this zaniness really keeps your attention and makes the movie very fast paced and enjoyable. The main character of Ash is one of my favorite movie character's ever because of Bruce Campbell's performance, he's able to do serious acting when needed and at the same time he's able to be campy when needed. Whats surprising for the type of movie this is, is how good the camera work is. You get so many shots at many different things that are all edited together perfectly. But the movies biggest strength would be most other movie's biggest weakness, and that is the flaws in the movie, the little imperfections. These imperfections work in the favor of the movies campyness and they make the movie perfect because you can tell that everyone working on the movie put there best effort into it. It showed that they didn't make the movie to make money, they made it to make an enjoyable camp filled horror comedy that will stand the test of time. So does this movie still remain at the top for me? Yes it does. It stays at the top for it's enjoyment, horror, comedy, camp, and all around the inspiration factor that says "make your own movie to just make a movie" my rating 10 out of 10. In the words of Roger Ebert the movie is "Manic, inspired genius. A great time!" and in my own words "It's the most original, and entertaining horror film ever made"

    More of the same from Sam Raimi and company, with Bruce Campbell and his girlfriend heading up to that rickety cabin and unleashing more demons who possess dispensable supporting characters. This time the rampant splatter isn't that much fun; the constant barrage of blood, gore, goo, shouting and screaming quickly becomes tiresome, and only gets more annoying as this barmy racket rampages through its 84 minutes. There's a welcome vein of black humour (like the girlfriend's head in a vice), but it's really Campbell who makes it worth watching: he gives it all he's got as possibly the most abused character in cinema. At one point the poor guy sits down for a rest and his chair falls to pieces! Better than the first movie, then - but not exactly good.

    To put my reviews in better perspective I read the one star reviews posted and I am pretty much disgusted. Here are a few thing you need to know about this movie: This is a sequel, it is not unoriginal because it was one of the first movies in the gorefest genre, and it blends horror and comedy. Now onto the movie itself. This is in an everlasting battle for my favorite movie of all time, with the first Evil Dead of course. I have an extreme respect for this movie no matter how ridiculous it gets or how despised it is. In my opinion this is probably one of the easiest horror movies to watch because unlike most horror films it has a story, characters who can defend themselves, and breaks from the nonstop scares, which makes the scares even more effective. I loved this movie the first time I saw it and more than likely will love it to the day I die.

    I must say I never had time for the 'slice-up the helpless victims' genre of horror films, even though I spent most of the 90s working my way through the Friday 13th/Halloween films (Part6+Jason goes to Hell/Curse of Michael Myers my favourites because they break that mold). For that reason I never really cared much for The Evil Dead which fell very squarely into that genre but love, love, love Evil Dead 2 because it's so very different. It simply oozes imagination from every pore, the pace is relentless and the slapstick humour wonderfully relentless. No insult to the rest of the cast but a terrific performance from Bruce Campbell who without a shadow of a doubt owns this film (although a great deal of credit must go to Ted Rami who suffered horribly in his bodysuit as the witch in the cellar, the bit where he tips his head to the side only for all the sweat to drip out is much more horrific than any of the fake gore on screen). It's funny now to think that this was considered one of the 'video nasties' at the time of its' release, it looks so tame nowadays. Sure there's a lot of blood Shining style but the bodycount is in single figures, it's not at all sadistic and actually is pretty tongue-in-cheek and good humoured. A great thing about the DVD is the commentary, Bruce Campbell and Sam Rami are just wonderful with their comments, informative and funny as hell. Shame no Bob Tapert to complete the trio. All told an irreplaceable classic

    As a trilogy, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series doesn't really weigh up. The first film is an ultra low-budget  but quite suspensefully made  gore film, containing many genuinely unnerving moments thanks to its clever camera work and editing. The second and third films in the series change the tone and style completely, aiming instead for a cartoonishly over-the-top comedy feel  'slapstick gore' as it has been described in some circles, reminiscent of a Three Stooges movie except that it's full of dismemberment and other such bloody delights. If you're after a serious, genuinely scary style of film, then Part One is the one to watch. If you're after something spectacularly bloody yet simultaneously humorous, then numbers 2 and 3 fit the bill. For me, the original Evil Dead is a quintessential master-class in low budget horror-making skillful, tight, often very frightening. This sequel doesn't really work, showing too much affinity for its madcap gore and monsters. Evil Dead II has a much larger cult following than its predecessor but, at risk of upsetting this army of loyal fans, I'm going to stick my neck out and admit I really don't like it. Survivor of the original film Ash (Bruce Campbell) is unable to escape from the woodland cabin where he so recently endured the mother of all bad nights. Trapped for yet another evening, he prepares himself to endure more freakish horrors as the light begins to fade. He is joined by four outsiders  Annie (Sarah Berry), whose parents originally unleashed the demons in the cabin whilst researching the Book of the Dead; Ed (Richard Domeier), a professor who is also Annie's research partner and boyfriend; Jake (Dan Hicks), a white-trash handyman; and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva), Jake's air-headed trailer-trash girlfriend. The five inhabitants of the cabin are left to endure various spooky events, bloodthirsty demon attacks, bodily possessions/invasions, and so on and so forth, before they finally figure out a way to send the demons back from whence they came. Raimi's bigger budget proves a curse rather than a blessing here. He doesn't need to build up to the shock moments slowly and carefully this time around. If he requires an elaborate monster to pop up suddenly, then that is just what happens if he needs gallons of blood and bile to gush forth rather than a mere trickle, then gallons is what he gets. The unfortunate thing is that the original worked so well because Raimi had figured out that often less can be more  his slow and skillful build-ups created real intensity. That philosophy is completely dismissed here, as Raimi opts to throw a non-stop barrage of gross and gooey carnage at the viewer right from the start. There's still a degree of inventiveness on show, especially in the scene where Ash has to sever his own hand after it becomes possessed. The sight of his uncontrollable 'demon hand' smashing plates over his head and trying to gouge at his own face, not to mention dragging his unconscious body across the floor, is rather funny. Sadly, in other parts of the film much of the humour over-shoots the mark, coming across as 'frantic' and 'hysterical' rather than genuinely funny. The acting is pretty terrible all-round. Campbell has a goofy self-confidence which enables him to nearly get away with it but the others simply look inept, their hopelessly amateurish efforts serving only to damage the film further. Evil Dead II will undoubtedly appeal to some, with its penchant for bad taste comedy and breakneck slapstick carnage. However, if its outlandish sense of humour is not to your taste, you may find this a very long 84 minutes indeed.

    This one actually surpasses the original in just about every way. Out of the "Evil Dead" trilogy most people refer to "Evil Dead 2" for a reason. Two is basically what makes this trilogy stand out. This is probably the film that made Ash a iconic figure in the horror genre and probably made the chainsaw the iconic horror weapon. It's more crazy and humorous than before and has way more supernatural elements going on. In fact this time the whole cabin looks like it's been possessed. Bruce Campbell again plays Ash but he now feels like a trademark character in these genre. His facial expressions and his crazy laughs are a classic. Everything is just more humorous this time around in a good way. It just has many innovative elements which adds onto the originality from the first. This one is a classic for a reason and shouldn't be missed out on. Especially if your into the horror genre. 8.6/10

    This is a cabin on cocaine!! Ash returns for the role of Evil Dead 2 giving out his best performance yet!! Poor Ash is getting tormented by the demons messing with his mind and himself. Sam Ramini gives out more of his classic camera-work making this movie work how it should be. The woods running, the reversed footage, and gory effects. I loved how ED2 completely changed from a good straight up horror movie as ED1 to a comedy/horror. Its a perfect balance for the Evil Dead trilogy. Ash from becoming a wimp in ED1 to a hero in ED2. What kind of action star has a chainsaw connected to their hand and a their trusty boomstick... Ash of course!! And forever he will be one of the greatest horror icon. This movie will live on!

For that reason I never really cared much for The Evil Dead which fell very squarely into that genre but love, love, love Evil Dead 2 because it's so very different. It simply oozes imagination from every pore, the pace is relentless and the slapstick humour wonderfully relentless. No insult to the rest of the cast but a terrific performance from Bruce Campbell who without a shadow of a doubt owns this film (although a great deal of credit must go to Ted Rami who suffered horribly in his bodysuit as the witch in the cellar, the bit where he tips his head to the side only for all the sweat to drip out is much more horrific than any of the fake gore on screen). It's funny now to think that this was considered one of the 'video nasties' at the time of its' release, it looks so tame nowadays. Sure there's a lot of blood Shining style but the bodycount is in single figures, it's not at all sadistic and actually is pretty tongue-in-cheek and good humoured. A great thing about the DVD is the commentary, Bruce Campbell and Sam Rami are just wonderful with their comments, informative and funny as hell. Shame no Bob Tapert to complete the trio. All told an irreplaceable classic

    As a trilogy, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series doesn't really weigh up. The first film is an ultra low-budget  but quite suspensefully made  gore film, containing many genuinely unnerving moments thanks to its clever camera work and editing. The second and third films in the series change the tone and style completely, aiming instead for a cartoonishly over-the-top comedy feel  'slapstick gore' as it has been described in some circles, reminiscent of a Three Stooges movie except that it's full of dismemberment and other such bloody delights. If you're after a serious, genuinely scary style of film, then Part One is the one to watch. If you're after something spectacularly bloody yet simultaneously humorous, then numbers 2 and 3 fit the bill. For me, the original Evil Dead is a quintessential master-class in low budget horror-making skillful, tight, often very frightening. This sequel doesn't really work, showing too much affinity for its madcap gore and monsters. Evil Dead II has a much larger cult following than its predecessor but, at risk of upsetting this army of loyal fans, I'm going to stick my neck out and admit I really don't like it. Survivor of the original film Ash (Bruce Campbell) is unable to escape from the woodland cabin where he so recently endured the mother of all bad nights. Trapped for yet another evening, he prepares himself to endure more freakish horrors as the light begins to fade. He is joined by four outsiders  Annie (Sarah Berry), whose parents originally unleashed the demons in the cabin whilst researching the Book of the Dead; Ed (Richard Domeier), a professor who is also Annie's research partner and boyfriend; Jake (Dan Hicks), a white-trash handyman; and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva), Jake's air-headed trailer-trash girlfriend. The five inhabitants of the cabin are left to endure various spooky events, bloodthirsty demon attacks, bodily possessions/invasions, and so on and so forth, before they finally figure out a way to send the demons back from whence they came. Raimi's bigger budget proves a curse rather than a blessing here. He doesn't need to build up to the shock moments slowly and carefully this time around. If he requires an elaborate monster to pop up suddenly, then that is just what happens if he needs gallons of blood and bile to gush forth rather than a mere trickle, then gallons is what he gets. The unfortunate thing is that the original worked so well because Raimi had figured out that often less can be more  his slow and skillful build-ups created real intensity. That philosophy is completely dismissed here, as Raimi opts to throw a non-stop barrage of gross and gooey carnage at the viewer right from the start. There's still a degree of inventiveness on show, especially in the scene where Ash has to sever his own hand after it becomes possessed. The sight of his uncontrollable 'demon hand' smashing plates over his head and trying to gouge at his own face, not to mention dragging his unconscious body across the floor, is rather funny. Sadly, in other parts of the film much of the humour over-shoots the mark, coming across as 'frantic' and 'hysterical' rather than genuinely funny. The acting is pretty terrible all-round. Campbell has a goofy self-confidence which enables him to nearly get away with it but the others simply look inept, their hopelessly amateurish efforts serving only to damage the film further. Evil Dead II will undoubtedly appeal to some, with its penchant for bad taste comedy and breakneck slapstick carnage. However, if its outlandish sense of humour is not to your taste, you may find this a very long 84 minutes indeed.

    This one actually surpasses the original in just about every way. Out of the "Evil Dead" trilogy most people refer to "Evil Dead 2" for a reason. Two is basically what makes this trilogy stand out. This is probably the film that made Ash a iconic figure in the horror genre and probably made the chainsaw the iconic horror weapon. It's more crazy and humorous than before and has way more supernatural elements going on. In fact this time the whole cabin looks like it's been possessed. Bruce Campbell again plays Ash but he now feels like a trademark character in these genre. His facial expressions and his crazy laughs are a classic. Everything is just more humorous this time around in a good way. It just has many innovative elements which adds onto the originality from the first. This one is a classic for a reason and shouldn't be missed out on. Especially if your into the horror genre. 8.6/10

    This is a cabin on cocaine!! Ash returns for the role of Evil Dead 2 giving out his best performance yet!! Poor Ash is getting tormented by the demons messing with his mind and himself. Sam Ramini gives out more of his classic camera-work making this movie work how it should be. The woods running, the reversed footage, and gory effects. I loved how ED2 completely changed from a good straight up horror movie as ED1 to a comedy/horror. Its a perfect balance for the Evil Dead trilogy. Ash from becoming a wimp in ED1 to a hero in ED2. What kind of action star has a chainsaw connected to their hand and a their trusty boomstick... Ash of course!! And forever he will be one of the greatest horror icon. This movie will live on!

    Evil Dead II (1987): The Good, the Bad and the Heroic Synopsis: Classic "go to abandoned cabin in the woods and bad things happen" style of movie starring Bruce Campbell, who reprises his role as Ash Williams. Technically more of a reboot than a sequel, the movie follows Ash and his love interest back to the little cabin in the woods where another reading from "The Book of the Dead" makes things rather interesting for its new inhabitants. The Good: Honestly, if you can't watch this movie and have a freakin' blast doing so.... I don't know what is wrong with you. For starters, don't take yourself or the movie so seriously... life, and this movie, are better that way. Raimi takes the concept of the original film and sort of reboots it (which can be a little confusing upon first view). It's basically the original Evil Dead on steroids. The result is a MORE over-the-top version of the original where Ash is now solely in control of the screen time, which is a marvelous thing. It's almost like Raimi and his writers are sitting in a room thinking, "How much ridiculously awesome stuff can we throw on the screen? Okay, yeah... let's do all of this!". It's brilliant. He leaves nothing on the table and the result is a wild, wacky movie with a frenetic pace. You just have no idea where he is going to take you next and it's a hoot. Also, the fact that he centers the movie around Bruce Campbell was a wise decision and ultimately makes it comparable to the original. If a different casting decision is made, this one is likely forgotten and Army of Darkness never happens. The Bad: Well, the fact that it's basically a retelling of the original story (or maybe "re-imagined" is a better way of saying it) is a cop out of sorts. Most would think a sequel (thus the name of "Evil Dead II") would pick up where we all left off. But no, Raimi instead revisits old stomping grounds. If he had failed to come up with new ideas, this would be a big problem, but thankfully, the acting of Campbell and the wild imagination of Raimi save this movie and honestly, make it very comparable in quality to the original - which from me, is high praise for the sequel. Some of the effects are tad out of date, sure... but the fact that the film is a little more black comedy versus straight-up horror helps the film date a little better. The characters not named "Ash" are pretty boring as well. Or maybe it is just that they are overshadowed by Campbell's performance. Either way, this tends to bog down the later parts of the movie a bit. The Heroic: Speaking of Campbell's performance... it is one of the all-time greats. In a vacuum of performances, Campbell's is truly Oscar-worthy, which many might think is a ridiculous thought. Still, I can't think of a single other "A-lister" that could do what he did and bring more value within the confines of what this movie is. In fact, Bruce Campbell IS the movie! Watching him slowly go insane is one of cinema's true pleasures. Campbell lays it all on the line and not for a minute does he disappoint. His catapult to cult status is no coincidence. It was well earned.

    Just finished watching Evil Dead II and it certainly delivers the goods! I found this sequel very entertaining, funny and original, but at the same time a bit less scary and disturbing than the first one. There are a lot of memorable scenes where crazy stuff happens to poor Ash, who had already suffered a lot in the first film. Speaking of which, Bruce Campbell is totally insane here and I appreciated his over the top performance, making his character much more interesting this time. Also, the practical effects are more polished and improved. Maybe it's just me, but I actually found the ones used in the The Evil Dead I more effective. I can't really say which one is my favorite so far since they are very distinct from each other and are both great. Now I will be heading to Army of Darkness, which appears to be one hell of a ride too.

    While Sam Raimi did base the first Evil Dead movie on his short movie "Within the woods" (a short a lot of people would love to see someday, but there are some issues with it, either rights issues or the material is not good enough, I guess), this is a sequel/remake of the first one. It seems like he was ahead of his time. We do get a "previously on Evil Dead" segment in the beginning, but it doesn't show the events that unfold as they were portrayed in the previous movie. It's like a short movie that changes the back-story a little bit. It also is a bit funnier than the first movie. Bruce Campbell is more than able to squeeze funny out of some situations. So while it seems like more of the same it is still more than entertaining.

    Evil Dead 2 has been my favorite movie for a long time now, but recently I started to think it may not be as great as I remember it from 6 months ago. So I gave it a re-watch to see if it still holds up. The movies plot is very simple, people trapped in a cabin while demons attack them, seams simple enough, but the crazy stuff that the demons do to the people make this movie immensely entertaining. The hero of the movie is Ash, and he's already survived the first Evil Dead and now he's the only survivor. but later on the owners of the cabin return to it and then they all need to fight to stay alive. The movies writing felt very natural in the way the people talked and interacted with another, but that doesn't mean it's without it's campy one-liners. The campy one- liners are all memorable and don't hold the movie back, if anything it helps the movie. Now the main thing about the movie that holds your attention is that you have no idea whats going to be thrown at our protagonist next. It could be trees attacking the cabin, your own hand getting possessed, or an eye popping out of a skull and into someones mouth, all this zaniness really keeps your attention and makes the movie very fast paced and enjoyable. The main character of Ash is one of my favorite movie character's ever because of Bruce Campbell's performance, he's able to do serious acting when needed and at the same time he's able to be campy when needed. Whats surprising for the type of movie this is, is how good the camera work is. You get so many shots at many different things that are all edited together perfectly. But the movies biggest strength would be most other movie's biggest weakness, and that is the flaws in the movie, the little imperfections. These imperfections work in the favor of the movies campyness and they make the movie perfect because you can tell that everyone working on the movie put there best effort into it. It showed that they didn't make the movie to make money, they made it to make an enjoyable camp filled horror comedy that will stand the test of time. So does this movie still remain at the top for me? Yes it does. It stays at the top for it's enjoyment, horror, comedy, camp, and all around the inspiration factor that says "make your own movie to just make a movie" my rating 10 out of 10. In the words of Roger Ebert the movie is "Manic, inspired genius. A great time!" and in my own words "It's the most original, and entertaining horror film ever made"

    More of the same from Sam Raimi and company, with Bruce Campbell and his girlfriend heading up to that rickety cabin and unleashing more demons who possess dispensable supporting characters. This time the rampant splatter isn't that much fun; the constant barrage of blood, gore, goo, shouting and screaming quickly becomes tiresome, and only gets more annoying as this barmy racket rampages through its 84 minutes. There's a welcome vein of black humour (like the girlfriend's head in a vice), but it's really Campbell who makes it worth watching: he gives it all he's got as possibly the most abused character in cinema. At one point the poor guy sits down for a rest and his chair falls to pieces! Better than the first movie, then - but not exactly good.

    To put my reviews in better perspective I read the one star reviews posted and I am pretty much disgusted. Here are a few thing you need to know about this movie: This is a sequel, it is not unoriginal because it was one of the first movies in the gorefest genre, and it blends horror and comedy. Now onto the movie itself. This is in an everlasting battle for my favorite movie of all time, with the first Evil Dead of course. I have an extreme respect for this movie no matter how ridiculous it gets or how despised it is. In my opinion this is probably one of the easiest horror movies to watch because unlike most horror films it has a story, characters who can defend themselves, and breaks from the nonstop scares, which makes the scares even more effective. I loved this movie the first time I saw it and more than likely will love it to the day I die.

So I gave it a re-watch to see if it still holds up. The movies plot is very simple, people trapped in a cabin while demons attack them, seams simple enough, but the crazy stuff that the demons do to the people make this movie immensely entertaining. The hero of the movie is Ash, and he's already survived the first Evil Dead and now he's the only survivor. but later on the owners of the cabin return to it and then they all need to fight to stay alive. The movies writing felt very natural in the way the people talked and interacted with another, but that doesn't mean it's without it's campy one-liners. The campy one- liners are all memorable and don't hold the movie back, if anything it helps the movie. Now the main thing about the movie that holds your attention is that you have no idea whats going to be thrown at our protagonist next. It could be trees attacking the cabin, your own hand getting possessed, or an eye popping out of a skull and into someones mouth, all this zaniness really keeps your attention and makes the movie very fast paced and enjoyable. The main character of Ash is one of my favorite movie character's ever because of Bruce Campbell's performance, he's able to do serious acting when needed and at the same time he's able to be campy when needed. Whats surprising for the type of movie this is, is how good the camera work is. You get so many shots at many different things that are all edited together perfectly. But the movies biggest strength would be most other movie's biggest weakness, and that is the flaws in the movie, the little imperfections. These imperfections work in the favor of the movies campyness and they make the movie perfect because you can tell that everyone working on the movie put there best effort into it. It showed that they didn't make the movie to make money, they made it to make an enjoyable camp filled horror comedy that will stand the test of time. So does this movie still remain at the top for me? Yes it does. It stays at the top for it's enjoyment, horror, comedy, camp, and all around the inspiration factor that says "make your own movie to just make a movie" my rating 10 out of 10. In the words of Roger Ebert the movie is "Manic, inspired genius. A great time!" and in my own words "It's the most original, and entertaining horror film ever made"

    More of the same from Sam Raimi and company, with Bruce Campbell and his girlfriend heading up to that rickety cabin and unleashing more demons who possess dispensable supporting characters. This time the rampant splatter isn't that much fun; the constant barrage of blood, gore, goo, shouting and screaming quickly becomes tiresome, and only gets more annoying as this barmy racket rampages through its 84 minutes. There's a welcome vein of black humour (like the girlfriend's head in a vice), but it's really Campbell who makes it worth watching: he gives it all he's got as possibly the most abused character in cinema. At one point the poor guy sits down for a rest and his chair falls to pieces! Better than the first movie, then - but not exactly good.

    To put my reviews in better perspective I read the one star reviews posted and I am pretty much disgusted. Here are a few thing you need to know about this movie: This is a sequel, it is not unoriginal because it was one of the first movies in the gorefest genre, and it blends horror and comedy. Now onto the movie itself. This is in an everlasting battle for my favorite movie of all time, with the first Evil Dead of course. I have an extreme respect for this movie no matter how ridiculous it gets or how despised it is. In my opinion this is probably one of the easiest horror movies to watch because unlike most horror films it has a story, characters who can defend themselves, and breaks from the nonstop scares, which makes the scares even more effective. I loved this movie the first time I saw it and more than likely will love it to the day I die.

    I must say I never had time for the 'slice-up the helpless victims' genre of horror films, even though I spent most of the 90s working my way through the Friday 13th/Halloween films (Part6+Jason goes to Hell/Curse of Michael Myers my favourites because they break that mold). For that reason I never really cared much for The Evil Dead which fell very squarely into that genre but love, love, love Evil Dead 2 because it's so very different. It simply oozes imagination from every pore, the pace is relentless and the slapstick humour wonderfully relentless. No insult to the rest of the cast but a terrific performance from Bruce Campbell who without a shadow of a doubt owns this film (although a great deal of credit must go to Ted Rami who suffered horribly in his bodysuit as the witch in the cellar, the bit where he tips his head to the side only for all the sweat to drip out is much more horrific than any of the fake gore on screen). It's funny now to think that this was considered one of the 'video nasties' at the time of its' release, it looks so tame nowadays. Sure there's a lot of blood Shining style but the bodycount is in single figures, it's not at all sadistic and actually is pretty tongue-in-cheek and good humoured. A great thing about the DVD is the commentary, Bruce Campbell and Sam Rami are just wonderful with their comments, informative and funny as hell. Shame no Bob Tapert to complete the trio. All told an irreplaceable classic

    As a trilogy, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series doesn't really weigh up. The first film is an ultra low-budget  but quite suspensefully made  gore film, containing many genuinely unnerving moments thanks to its clever camera work and editing. The second and third films in the series change the tone and style completely, aiming instead for a cartoonishly over-the-top comedy feel  'slapstick gore' as it has been described in some circles, reminiscent of a Three Stooges movie except that it's full of dismemberment and other such bloody delights. If you're after a serious, genuinely scary style of film, then Part One is the one to watch. If you're after something spectacularly bloody yet simultaneously humorous, then numbers 2 and 3 fit the bill. For me, the original Evil Dead is a quintessential master-class in low budget horror-making skillful, tight, often very frightening. This sequel doesn't really work, showing too much affinity for its madcap gore and monsters. Evil Dead II has a much larger cult following than its predecessor but, at risk of upsetting this army of loyal fans, I'm going to stick my neck out and admit I really don't like it. Survivor of the original film Ash (Bruce Campbell) is unable to escape from the woodland cabin where he so recently endured the mother of all bad nights. Trapped for yet another evening, he prepares himself to endure more freakish horrors as the light begins to fade. He is joined by four outsiders  Annie (Sarah Berry), whose parents originally unleashed the demons in the cabin whilst researching the Book of the Dead; Ed (Richard Domeier), a professor who is also Annie's research partner and boyfriend; Jake (Dan Hicks), a white-trash handyman; and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva), Jake's air-headed trailer-trash girlfriend. The five inhabitants of the cabin are left to endure various spooky events, bloodthirsty demon attacks, bodily possessions/invasions, and so on and so forth, before they finally figure out a way to send the demons back from whence they came. Raimi's bigger budget proves a curse rather than a blessing here. He doesn't need to build up to the shock moments slowly and carefully this time around. If he requires an elaborate monster to pop up suddenly, then that is just what happens if he needs gallons of blood and bile to gush forth rather than a mere trickle, then gallons is what he gets. The unfortunate thing is that the original worked so well because Raimi had figured out that often less can be more  his slow and skillful build-ups created real intensity. That philosophy is completely dismissed here, as Raimi opts to throw a non-stop barrage of gross and gooey carnage at the viewer right from the start. There's still a degree of inventiveness on show, especially in the scene where Ash has to sever his own hand after it becomes possessed. The sight of his uncontrollable 'demon hand' smashing plates over his head and trying to gouge at his own face, not to mention dragging his unconscious body across the floor, is rather funny. Sadly, in other parts of the film much of the humour over-shoots the mark, coming across as 'frantic' and 'hysterical' rather than genuinely funny. The acting is pretty terrible all-round. Campbell has a goofy self-confidence which enables him to nearly get away with it but the others simply look inept, their hopelessly amateurish efforts serving only to damage the film further. Evil Dead II will undoubtedly appeal to some, with its penchant for bad taste comedy and breakneck slapstick carnage. However, if its outlandish sense of humour is not to your taste, you may find this a very long 84 minutes indeed.

    This one actually surpasses the original in just about every way. Out of the "Evil Dead" trilogy most people refer to "Evil Dead 2" for a reason. Two is basically what makes this trilogy stand out. This is probably the film that made Ash a iconic figure in the horror genre and probably made the chainsaw the iconic horror weapon. It's more crazy and humorous than before and has way more supernatural elements going on. In fact this time the whole cabin looks like it's been possessed. Bruce Campbell again plays Ash but he now feels like a trademark character in these genre. His facial expressions and his crazy laughs are a classic. Everything is just more humorous this time around in a good way. It just has many innovative elements which adds onto the originality from the first. This one is a classic for a reason and shouldn't be missed out on. Especially if your into the horror genre. 8.6/10

    This is a cabin on cocaine!! Ash returns for the role of Evil Dead 2 giving out his best performance yet!! Poor Ash is getting tormented by the demons messing with his mind and himself. Sam Ramini gives out more of his classic camera-work making this movie work how it should be. The woods running, the reversed footage, and gory effects. I loved how ED2 completely changed from a good straight up horror movie as ED1 to a comedy/horror. Its a perfect balance for the Evil Dead trilogy. Ash from becoming a wimp in ED1 to a hero in ED2. What kind of action star has a chainsaw connected to their hand and a their trusty boomstick... Ash of course!! And forever he will be one of the greatest horror icon. This movie will live on!

    Evil Dead II (1987): The Good, the Bad and the Heroic Synopsis: Classic "go to abandoned cabin in the woods and bad things happen" style of movie starring Bruce Campbell, who reprises his role as Ash Williams. Technically more of a reboot than a sequel, the movie follows Ash and his love interest back to the little cabin in the woods where another reading from "The Book of the Dead" makes things rather interesting for its new inhabitants. The Good: Honestly, if you can't watch this movie and have a freakin' blast doing so.... I don't know what is wrong with you. For starters, don't take yourself or the movie so seriously... life, and this movie, are better that way. Raimi takes the concept of the original film and sort of reboots it (which can be a little confusing upon first view). It's basically the original Evil Dead on steroids. The result is a MORE over-the-top version of the original where Ash is now solely in control of the screen time, which is a marvelous thing. It's almost like Raimi and his writers are sitting in a room thinking, "How much ridiculously awesome stuff can we throw on the screen? Okay, yeah... let's do all of this!". It's brilliant. He leaves nothing on the table and the result is a wild, wacky movie with a frenetic pace. You just have no idea where he is going to take you next and it's a hoot. Also, the fact that he centers the movie around Bruce Campbell was a wise decision and ultimately makes it comparable to the original. If a different casting decision is made, this one is likely forgotten and Army of Darkness never happens. The Bad: Well, the fact that it's basically a retelling of the original story (or maybe "re-imagined" is a better way of saying it) is a cop out of sorts. Most would think a sequel (thus the name of "Evil Dead II") would pick up where we all left off. But no, Raimi instead revisits old stomping grounds. If he had failed to come up with new ideas, this would be a big problem, but thankfully, the acting of Campbell and the wild imagination of Raimi save this movie and honestly, make it very comparable in quality to the original - which from me, is high praise for the sequel. Some of the effects are tad out of date, sure... but the fact that the film is a little more black comedy versus straight-up horror helps the film date a little better. The characters not named "Ash" are pretty boring as well. Or maybe it is just that they are overshadowed by Campbell's performance. Either way, this tends to bog down the later parts of the movie a bit. The Heroic: Speaking of Campbell's performance... it is one of the all-time greats. In a vacuum of performances, Campbell's is truly Oscar-worthy, which many might think is a ridiculous thought. Still, I can't think of a single other "A-lister" that could do what he did and bring more value within the confines of what this movie is. In fact, Bruce Campbell IS the movie! Watching him slowly go insane is one of cinema's true pleasures. Campbell lays it all on the line and not for a minute does he disappoint. His catapult to cult status is no coincidence. It was well earned.

    Just finished watching Evil Dead II and it certainly delivers the goods! I found this sequel very entertaining, funny and original, but at the same time a bit less scary and disturbing than the first one. There are a lot of memorable scenes where crazy stuff happens to poor Ash, who had already suffered a lot in the first film. Speaking of which, Bruce Campbell is totally insane here and I appreciated his over the top performance, making his character much more interesting this time. Also, the practical effects are more polished and improved. Maybe it's just me, but I actually found the ones used in the The Evil Dead I more effective. I can't really say which one is my favorite so far since they are very distinct from each other and are both great. Now I will be heading to Army of Darkness, which appears to be one hell of a ride too.

    While Sam Raimi did base the first Evil Dead movie on his short movie "Within the woods" (a short a lot of people would love to see someday, but there are some issues with it, either rights issues or the material is not good enough, I guess), this is a sequel/remake of the first one. It seems like he was ahead of his time. We do get a "previously on Evil Dead" segment in the beginning, but it doesn't show the events that unfold as they were portrayed in the previous movie. It's like a short movie that changes the back-story a little bit. It also is a bit funnier than the first movie. Bruce Campbell is more than able to squeeze funny out of some situations. So while it seems like more of the same it is still more than entertaining.

Raimi takes the concept of the original film and sort of reboots it (which can be a little confusing upon first view). It's basically the original Evil Dead on steroids. The result is a MORE over-the-top version of the original where Ash is now solely in control of the screen time, which is a marvelous thing. It's almost like Raimi and his writers are sitting in a room thinking, "How much ridiculously awesome stuff can we throw on the screen? Okay, yeah... let's do all of this!". It's brilliant. He leaves nothing on the table and the result is a wild, wacky movie with a frenetic pace. You just have no idea where he is going to take you next and it's a hoot. Also, the fact that he centers the movie around Bruce Campbell was a wise decision and ultimately makes it comparable to the original. If a different casting decision is made, this one is likely forgotten and Army of Darkness never happens. The Bad: Well, the fact that it's basically a retelling of the original story (or maybe "re-imagined" is a better way of saying it) is a cop out of sorts. Most would think a sequel (thus the name of "Evil Dead II") would pick up where we all left off. But no, Raimi instead revisits old stomping grounds. If he had failed to come up with new ideas, this would be a big problem, but thankfully, the acting of Campbell and the wild imagination of Raimi save this movie and honestly, make it very comparable in quality to the original - which from me, is high praise for the sequel. Some of the effects are tad out of date, sure... but the fact that the film is a little more black comedy versus straight-up horror helps the film date a little better. The characters not named "Ash" are pretty boring as well. Or maybe it is just that they are overshadowed by Campbell's performance. Either way, this tends to bog down the later parts of the movie a bit. The Heroic: Speaking of Campbell's performance... it is one of the all-time greats. In a vacuum of performances, Campbell's is truly Oscar-worthy, which many might think is a ridiculous thought. Still, I can't think of a single other "A-lister" that could do what he did and bring more value within the confines of what this movie is. In fact, Bruce Campbell IS the movie! Watching him slowly go insane is one of cinema's true pleasures. Campbell lays it all on the line and not for a minute does he disappoint. His catapult to cult status is no coincidence. It was well earned.

    Just finished watching Evil Dead II and it certainly delivers the goods! I found this sequel very entertaining, funny and original, but at the same time a bit less scary and disturbing than the first one. There are a lot of memorable scenes where crazy stuff happens to poor Ash, who had already suffered a lot in the first film. Speaking of which, Bruce Campbell is totally insane here and I appreciated his over the top performance, making his character much more interesting this time. Also, the practical effects are more polished and improved. Maybe it's just me, but I actually found the ones used in the The Evil Dead I more effective. I can't really say which one is my favorite so far since they are very distinct from each other and are both great. Now I will be heading to Army of Darkness, which appears to be one hell of a ride too.

    While Sam Raimi did base the first Evil Dead movie on his short movie "Within the woods" (a short a lot of people would love to see someday, but there are some issues with it, either rights issues or the material is not good enough, I guess), this is a sequel/remake of the first one. It seems like he was ahead of his time. We do get a "previously on Evil Dead" segment in the beginning, but it doesn't show the events that unfold as they were portrayed in the previous movie. It's like a short movie that changes the back-story a little bit. It also is a bit funnier than the first movie. Bruce Campbell is more than able to squeeze funny out of some situations. So while it seems like more of the same it is still more than entertaining.

    Evil Dead 2 has been my favorite movie for a long time now, but recently I started to think it may not be as great as I remember it from 6 months ago. So I gave it a re-watch to see if it still holds up. The movies plot is very simple, people trapped in a cabin while demons attack them, seams simple enough, but the crazy stuff that the demons do to the people make this movie immensely entertaining. The hero of the movie is Ash, and he's already survived the first Evil Dead and now he's the only survivor. but later on the owners of the cabin return to it and then they all need to fight to stay alive. The movies writing felt very natural in the way the people talked and interacted with another, but that doesn't mean it's without it's campy one-liners. The campy one- liners are all memorable and don't hold the movie back, if anything it helps the movie. Now the main thing about the movie that holds your attention is that you have no idea whats going to be thrown at our protagonist next. It could be trees attacking the cabin, your own hand getting possessed, or an eye popping out of a skull and into someones mouth, all this zaniness really keeps your attention and makes the movie very fast paced and enjoyable. The main character of Ash is one of my favorite movie character's ever because of Bruce Campbell's performance, he's able to do serious acting when needed and at the same time he's able to be campy when needed. Whats surprising for the type of movie this is, is how good the camera work is. You get so many shots at many different things that are all edited together perfectly. But the movies biggest strength would be most other movie's biggest weakness, and that is the flaws in the movie, the little imperfections. These imperfections work in the favor of the movies campyness and they make the movie perfect because you can tell that everyone working on the movie put there best effort into it. It showed that they didn't make the movie to make money, they made it to make an enjoyable camp filled horror comedy that will stand the test of time. So does this movie still remain at the top for me? Yes it does. It stays at the top for it's enjoyment, horror, comedy, camp, and all around the inspiration factor that says "make your own movie to just make a movie" my rating 10 out of 10. In the words of Roger Ebert the movie is "Manic, inspired genius. A great time!" and in my own words "It's the most original, and entertaining horror film ever made"

    More of the same from Sam Raimi and company, with Bruce Campbell and his girlfriend heading up to that rickety cabin and unleashing more demons who possess dispensable supporting characters. This time the rampant splatter isn't that much fun; the constant barrage of blood, gore, goo, shouting and screaming quickly becomes tiresome, and only gets more annoying as this barmy racket rampages through its 84 minutes. There's a welcome vein of black humour (like the girlfriend's head in a vice), but it's really Campbell who makes it worth watching: he gives it all he's got as possibly the most abused character in cinema. At one point the poor guy sits down for a rest and his chair falls to pieces! Better than the first movie, then - but not exactly good.

    To put my reviews in better perspective I read the one star reviews posted and I am pretty much disgusted. Here are a few thing you need to know about this movie: This is a sequel, it is not unoriginal because it was one of the first movies in the gorefest genre, and it blends horror and comedy. Now onto the movie itself. This is in an everlasting battle for my favorite movie of all time, with the first Evil Dead of course. I have an extreme respect for this movie no matter how ridiculous it gets or how despised it is. In my opinion this is probably one of the easiest horror movies to watch because unlike most horror films it has a story, characters who can defend themselves, and breaks from the nonstop scares, which makes the scares even more effective. I loved this movie the first time I saw it and more than likely will love it to the day I die.

    I must say I never had time for the 'slice-up the helpless victims' genre of horror films, even though I spent most of the 90s working my way through the Friday 13th/Halloween films (Part6+Jason goes to Hell/Curse of Michael Myers my favourites because they break that mold). For that reason I never really cared much for The Evil Dead which fell very squarely into that genre but love, love, love Evil Dead 2 because it's so very different. It simply oozes imagination from every pore, the pace is relentless and the slapstick humour wonderfully relentless. No insult to the rest of the cast but a terrific performance from Bruce Campbell who without a shadow of a doubt owns this film (although a great deal of credit must go to Ted Rami who suffered horribly in his bodysuit as the witch in the cellar, the bit where he tips his head to the side only for all the sweat to drip out is much more horrific than any of the fake gore on screen). It's funny now to think that this was considered one of the 'video nasties' at the time of its' release, it looks so tame nowadays. Sure there's a lot of blood Shining style but the bodycount is in single figures, it's not at all sadistic and actually is pretty tongue-in-cheek and good humoured. A great thing about the DVD is the commentary, Bruce Campbell and Sam Rami are just wonderful with their comments, informative and funny as hell. Shame no Bob Tapert to complete the trio. All told an irreplaceable classic

    As a trilogy, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series doesn't really weigh up. The first film is an ultra low-budget  but quite suspensefully made  gore film, containing many genuinely unnerving moments thanks to its clever camera work and editing. The second and third films in the series change the tone and style completely, aiming instead for a cartoonishly over-the-top comedy feel  'slapstick gore' as it has been described in some circles, reminiscent of a Three Stooges movie except that it's full of dismemberment and other such bloody delights. If you're after a serious, genuinely scary style of film, then Part One is the one to watch. If you're after something spectacularly bloody yet simultaneously humorous, then numbers 2 and 3 fit the bill. For me, the original Evil Dead is a quintessential master-class in low budget horror-making skillful, tight, often very frightening. This sequel doesn't really work, showing too much affinity for its madcap gore and monsters. Evil Dead II has a much larger cult following than its predecessor but, at risk of upsetting this army of loyal fans, I'm going to stick my neck out and admit I really don't like it. Survivor of the original film Ash (Bruce Campbell) is unable to escape from the woodland cabin where he so recently endured the mother of all bad nights. Trapped for yet another evening, he prepares himself to endure more freakish horrors as the light begins to fade. He is joined by four outsiders  Annie (Sarah Berry), whose parents originally unleashed the demons in the cabin whilst researching the Book of the Dead; Ed (Richard Domeier), a professor who is also Annie's research partner and boyfriend; Jake (Dan Hicks), a white-trash handyman; and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva), Jake's air-headed trailer-trash girlfriend. The five inhabitants of the cabin are left to endure various spooky events, bloodthirsty demon attacks, bodily possessions/invasions, and so on and so forth, before they finally figure out a way to send the demons back from whence they came. Raimi's bigger budget proves a curse rather than a blessing here. He doesn't need to build up to the shock moments slowly and carefully this time around. If he requires an elaborate monster to pop up suddenly, then that is just what happens if he needs gallons of blood and bile to gush forth rather than a mere trickle, then gallons is what he gets. The unfortunate thing is that the original worked so well because Raimi had figured out that often less can be more  his slow and skillful build-ups created real intensity. That philosophy is completely dismissed here, as Raimi opts to throw a non-stop barrage of gross and gooey carnage at the viewer right from the start. There's still a degree of inventiveness on show, especially in the scene where Ash has to sever his own hand after it becomes possessed. The sight of his uncontrollable 'demon hand' smashing plates over his head and trying to gouge at his own face, not to mention dragging his unconscious body across the floor, is rather funny. Sadly, in other parts of the film much of the humour over-shoots the mark, coming across as 'frantic' and 'hysterical' rather than genuinely funny. The acting is pretty terrible all-round. Campbell has a goofy self-confidence which enables him to nearly get away with it but the others simply look inept, their hopelessly amateurish efforts serving only to damage the film further. Evil Dead II will undoubtedly appeal to some, with its penchant for bad taste comedy and breakneck slapstick carnage. However, if its outlandish sense of humour is not to your taste, you may find this a very long 84 minutes indeed.

    This one actually surpasses the original in just about every way. Out of the "Evil Dead" trilogy most people refer to "Evil Dead 2" for a reason. Two is basically what makes this trilogy stand out. This is probably the film that made Ash a iconic figure in the horror genre and probably made the chainsaw the iconic horror weapon. It's more crazy and humorous than before and has way more supernatural elements going on. In fact this time the whole cabin looks like it's been possessed. Bruce Campbell again plays Ash but he now feels like a trademark character in these genre. His facial expressions and his crazy laughs are a classic. Everything is just more humorous this time around in a good way. It just has many innovative elements which adds onto the originality from the first. This one is a classic for a reason and shouldn't be missed out on. Especially if your into the horror genre. 8.6/10

    This is a cabin on cocaine!! Ash returns for the role of Evil Dead 2 giving out his best performance yet!! Poor Ash is getting tormented by the demons messing with his mind and himself. Sam Ramini gives out more of his classic camera-work making this movie work how it should be. The woods running, the reversed footage, and gory effects. I loved how ED2 completely changed from a good straight up horror movie as ED1 to a comedy/horror. Its a perfect balance for the Evil Dead trilogy. Ash from becoming a wimp in ED1 to a hero in ED2. What kind of action star has a chainsaw connected to their hand and a their trusty boomstick... Ash of course!! And forever he will be one of the greatest horror icon. This movie will live on!

    Evil Dead II (1987): The Good, the Bad and the Heroic Synopsis: Classic "go to abandoned cabin in the woods and bad things happen" style of movie starring Bruce Campbell, who reprises his role as Ash Williams. Technically more of a reboot than a sequel, the movie follows Ash and his love interest back to the little cabin in the woods where another reading from "The Book of the Dead" makes things rather interesting for its new inhabitants. The Good: Honestly, if you can't watch this movie and have a freakin' blast doing so.... I don't know what is wrong with you. For starters, don't take yourself or the movie so seriously... life, and this movie, are better that way. Raimi takes the concept of the original film and sort of reboots it (which can be a little confusing upon first view). It's basically the original Evil Dead on steroids. The result is a MORE over-the-top version of the original where Ash is now solely in control of the screen time, which is a marvelous thing. It's almost like Raimi and his writers are sitting in a room thinking, "How much ridiculously awesome stuff can we throw on the screen? Okay, yeah... let's do all of this!". It's brilliant. He leaves nothing on the table and the result is a wild, wacky movie with a frenetic pace. You just have no idea where he is going to take you next and it's a hoot.

He is joined by four outsiders  Annie (Sarah Berry), whose parents originally unleashed the demons in the cabin whilst researching the Book of the Dead; Ed (Richard Domeier), a professor who is also Annie's research partner and boyfriend; Jake (Dan Hicks), a white-trash handyman; and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva), Jake's air-headed trailer-trash girlfriend. The five inhabitants of the cabin are left to endure various spooky events, bloodthirsty demon attacks, bodily possessions/invasions, and so on and so forth, before they finally figure out a way to send the demons back from whence they came. Raimi's bigger budget proves a curse rather than a blessing here. He doesn't need to build up to the shock moments slowly and carefully this time around. If he requires an elaborate monster to pop up suddenly, then that is just what happens if he needs gallons of blood and bile to gush forth rather than a mere trickle, then gallons is what he gets. The unfortunate thing is that the original worked so well because Raimi had figured out that often less can be more  his slow and skillful build-ups created real intensity. That philosophy is completely dismissed here, as Raimi opts to throw a non-stop barrage of gross and gooey carnage at the viewer right from the start. There's still a degree of inventiveness on show, especially in the scene where Ash has to sever his own hand after it becomes possessed. The sight of his uncontrollable 'demon hand' smashing plates over his head and trying to gouge at his own face, not to mention dragging his unconscious body across the floor, is rather funny. Sadly, in other parts of the film much of the humour over-shoots the mark, coming across as 'frantic' and 'hysterical' rather than genuinely funny. The acting is pretty terrible all-round. Campbell has a goofy self-confidence which enables him to nearly get away with it but the others simply look inept, their hopelessly amateurish efforts serving only to damage the film further. Evil Dead II will undoubtedly appeal to some, with its penchant for bad taste comedy and breakneck slapstick carnage. However, if its outlandish sense of humour is not to your taste, you may find this a very long 84 minutes indeed.

    This one actually surpasses the original in just about every way. Out of the "Evil Dead" trilogy most people refer to "Evil Dead 2" for a reason. Two is basically what makes this trilogy stand out. This is probably the film that made Ash a iconic figure in the horror genre and probably made the chainsaw the iconic horror weapon. It's more crazy and humorous than before and has way more supernatural elements going on. In fact this time the whole cabin looks like it's been possessed. Bruce Campbell again plays Ash but he now feels like a trademark character in these genre. His facial expressions and his crazy laughs are a classic. Everything is just more humorous this time around in a good way. It just has many innovative elements which adds onto the originality from the first. This one is a classic for a reason and shouldn't be missed out on. Especially if your into the horror genre. 8.6/10

    This is a cabin on cocaine!! Ash returns for the role of Evil Dead 2 giving out his best performance yet!! Poor Ash is getting tormented by the demons messing with his mind and himself. Sam Ramini gives out more of his classic camera-work making this movie work how it should be. The woods running, the reversed footage, and gory effects. I loved how ED2 completely changed from a good straight up horror movie as ED1 to a comedy/horror. Its a perfect balance for the Evil Dead trilogy. Ash from becoming a wimp in ED1 to a hero in ED2. What kind of action star has a chainsaw connected to their hand and a their trusty boomstick... Ash of course!! And forever he will be one of the greatest horror icon. This movie will live on!

    Evil Dead II (1987): The Good, the Bad and the Heroic Synopsis: Classic "go to abandoned cabin in the woods and bad things happen" style of movie starring Bruce Campbell, who reprises his role as Ash Williams. Technically more of a reboot than a sequel, the movie follows Ash and his love interest back to the little cabin in the woods where another reading from "The Book of the Dead" makes things rather interesting for its new inhabitants. The Good: Honestly, if you can't watch this movie and have a freakin' blast doing so.... I don't know what is wrong with you. For starters, don't take yourself or the movie so seriously... life, and this movie, are better that way. Raimi takes the concept of the original film and sort of reboots it (which can be a little confusing upon first view). It's basically the original Evil Dead on steroids. The result is a MORE over-the-top version of the original where Ash is now solely in control of the screen time, which is a marvelous thing. It's almost like Raimi and his writers are sitting in a room thinking, "How much ridiculously awesome stuff can we throw on the screen? Okay, yeah... let's do all of this!". It's brilliant. He leaves nothing on the table and the result is a wild, wacky movie with a frenetic pace. You just have no idea where he is going to take you next and it's a hoot. Also, the fact that he centers the movie around Bruce Campbell was a wise decision and ultimately makes it comparable to the original. If a different casting decision is made, this one is likely forgotten and Army of Darkness never happens. The Bad: Well, the fact that it's basically a retelling of the original story (or maybe "re-imagined" is a better way of saying it) is a cop out of sorts. Most would think a sequel (thus the name of "Evil Dead II") would pick up where we all left off. But no, Raimi instead revisits old stomping grounds. If he had failed to come up with new ideas, this would be a big problem, but thankfully, the acting of Campbell and the wild imagination of Raimi save this movie and honestly, make it very comparable in quality to the original - which from me, is high praise for the sequel. Some of the effects are tad out of date, sure... but the fact that the film is a little more black comedy versus straight-up horror helps the film date a little better. The characters not named "Ash" are pretty boring as well. Or maybe it is just that they are overshadowed by Campbell's performance. Either way, this tends to bog down the later parts of the movie a bit. The Heroic: Speaking of Campbell's performance... it is one of the all-time greats. In a vacuum of performances, Campbell's is truly Oscar-worthy, which many might think is a ridiculous thought. Still, I can't think of a single other "A-lister" that could do what he did and bring more value within the confines of what this movie is. In fact, Bruce Campbell IS the movie! Watching him slowly go insane is one of cinema's true pleasures. Campbell lays it all on the line and not for a minute does he disappoint. His catapult to cult status is no coincidence. It was well earned.

    Just finished watching Evil Dead II and it certainly delivers the goods! I found this sequel very entertaining, funny and original, but at the same time a bit less scary and disturbing than the first one. There are a lot of memorable scenes where crazy stuff happens to poor Ash, who had already suffered a lot in the first film. Speaking of which, Bruce Campbell is totally insane here and I appreciated his over the top performance, making his character much more interesting this time. Also, the practical effects are more polished and improved. Maybe it's just me, but I actually found the ones used in the The Evil Dead I more effective. I can't really say which one is my favorite so far since they are very distinct from each other and are both great. Now I will be heading to Army of Darkness, which appears to be one hell of a ride too.

    While Sam Raimi did base the first Evil Dead movie on his short movie "Within the woods" (a short a lot of people would love to see someday, but there are some issues with it, either rights issues or the material is not good enough, I guess), this is a sequel/remake of the first one. It seems like he was ahead of his time. We do get a "previously on Evil Dead" segment in the beginning, but it doesn't show the events that unfold as they were portrayed in the previous movie. It's like a short movie that changes the back-story a little bit. It also is a bit funnier than the first movie. Bruce Campbell is more than able to squeeze funny out of some situations. So while it seems like more of the same it is still more than entertaining.

    Evil Dead 2 has been my favorite movie for a long time now, but recently I started to think it may not be as great as I remember it from 6 months ago. So I gave it a re-watch to see if it still holds up. The movies plot is very simple, people trapped in a cabin while demons attack them, seams simple enough, but the crazy stuff that the demons do to the people make this movie immensely entertaining. The hero of the movie is Ash, and he's already survived the first Evil Dead and now he's the only survivor. but later on the owners of the cabin return to it and then they all need to fight to stay alive. The movies writing felt very natural in the way the people talked and interacted with another, but that doesn't mean it's without it's campy one-liners. The campy one- liners are all memorable and don't hold the movie back, if anything it helps the movie. Now the main thing about the movie that holds your attention is that you have no idea whats going to be thrown at our protagonist next. It could be trees attacking the cabin, your own hand getting possessed, or an eye popping out of a skull and into someones mouth, all this zaniness really keeps your attention and makes the movie very fast paced and enjoyable. The main character of Ash is one of my favorite movie character's ever because of Bruce Campbell's performance, he's able to do serious acting when needed and at the same time he's able to be campy when needed. Whats surprising for the type of movie this is, is how good the camera work is. You get so many shots at many different things that are all edited together perfectly. But the movies biggest strength would be most other movie's biggest weakness, and that is the flaws in the movie, the little imperfections. These imperfections work in the favor of the movies campyness and they make the movie perfect because you can tell that everyone working on the movie put there best effort into it. It showed that they didn't make the movie to make money, they made it to make an enjoyable camp filled horror comedy that will stand the test of time. So does this movie still remain at the top for me? Yes it does. It stays at the top for it's enjoyment, horror, comedy, camp, and all around the inspiration factor that says "make your own movie to just make a movie" my rating 10 out of 10. In the words of Roger Ebert the movie is "Manic, inspired genius. A great time!" and in my own words "It's the most original, and entertaining horror film ever made"

    More of the same from Sam Raimi and company, with Bruce Campbell and his girlfriend heading up to that rickety cabin and unleashing more demons who possess dispensable supporting characters. This time the rampant splatter isn't that much fun; the constant barrage of blood, gore, goo, shouting and screaming quickly becomes tiresome, and only gets more annoying as this barmy racket rampages through its 84 minutes. There's a welcome vein of black humour (like the girlfriend's head in a vice), but it's really Campbell who makes it worth watching: he gives it all he's got as possibly the most abused character in cinema. At one point the poor guy sits down for a rest and his chair falls to pieces! Better than the first movie, then - but not exactly good.

    To put my reviews in better perspective I read the one star reviews posted and I am pretty much disgusted. Here are a few thing you need to know about this movie: This is a sequel, it is not unoriginal because it was one of the first movies in the gorefest genre, and it blends horror and comedy. Now onto the movie itself. This is in an everlasting battle for my favorite movie of all time, with the first Evil Dead of course. I have an extreme respect for this movie no matter how ridiculous it gets or how despised it is. In my opinion this is probably one of the easiest horror movies to watch because unlike most horror films it has a story, characters who can defend themselves, and breaks from the nonstop scares, which makes the scares even more effective. I loved this movie the first time I saw it and more than likely will love it to the day I die.

    I must say I never had time for the 'slice-up the helpless victims' genre of horror films, even though I spent most of the 90s working my way through the Friday 13th/Halloween films (Part6+Jason goes to Hell/Curse of Michael Myers my favourites because they break that mold). For that reason I never really cared much for The Evil Dead which fell very squarely into that genre but love, love, love Evil Dead 2 because it's so very different. It simply oozes imagination from every pore, the pace is relentless and the slapstick humour wonderfully relentless. No insult to the rest of the cast but a terrific performance from Bruce Campbell who without a shadow of a doubt owns this film (although a great deal of credit must go to Ted Rami who suffered horribly in his bodysuit as the witch in the cellar, the bit where he tips his head to the side only for all the sweat to drip out is much more horrific than any of the fake gore on screen). It's funny now to think that this was considered one of the 'video nasties' at the time of its' release, it looks so tame nowadays. Sure there's a lot of blood Shining style but the bodycount is in single figures, it's not at all sadistic and actually is pretty tongue-in-cheek and good humoured. A great thing about the DVD is the commentary, Bruce Campbell and Sam Rami are just wonderful with their comments, informative and funny as hell. Shame no Bob Tapert to complete the trio. All told an irreplaceable classic

    As a trilogy, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series doesn't really weigh up. The first film is an ultra low-budget  but quite suspensefully made  gore film, containing many genuinely unnerving moments thanks to its clever camera work and editing. The second and third films in the series change the tone and style completely, aiming instead for a cartoonishly over-the-top comedy feel  'slapstick gore' as it has been described in some circles, reminiscent of a Three Stooges movie except that it's full of dismemberment and other such bloody delights. If you're after a serious, genuinely scary style of film, then Part One is the one to watch. If you're after something spectacularly bloody yet simultaneously humorous, then numbers 2 and 3 fit the bill. For me, the original Evil Dead is a quintessential master-class in low budget horror-making skillful, tight, often very frightening. This sequel doesn't really work, showing too much affinity for its madcap gore and monsters. Evil Dead II has a much larger cult following than its predecessor but, at risk of upsetting this army of loyal fans, I'm going to stick my neck out and admit I really don't like it. Survivor of the original film Ash (Bruce Campbell) is unable to escape from the woodland cabin where he so recently endured the mother of all bad nights. Trapped for yet another evening, he prepares himself to endure more freakish horrors as the light begins to fade. He is joined by four outsiders  Annie (Sarah Berry), whose parents originally unleashed the demons in the cabin whilst researching the Book of the Dead; Ed (Richard Domeier), a professor who is also Annie's research partner and boyfriend; Jake (Dan Hicks), a white-trash handyman; and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva), Jake's air-headed trailer-trash girlfriend. The five inhabitants of the cabin are left to endure various spooky events, bloodthirsty demon attacks, bodily possessions/invasions, and so on and so forth, before they finally figure out a way to send the demons back from whence they came. Raimi's bigger budget proves a curse rather than a blessing here. He doesn't need to build up to the shock moments slowly and carefully this time around. If he requires an elaborate monster to pop up suddenly, then that is just what happens if he needs gallons of blood and bile to gush forth rather than a mere trickle, then gallons is what he gets. The unfortunate thing is that the original worked so well because Raimi had figured out that often less can be more  his slow and skillful build-ups created real intensity. That philosophy is completely dismissed here, as Raimi opts to throw a non-stop barrage of gross and gooey carnage at the viewer right from the start.

Sadly, in other parts of the film much of the humour over-shoots the mark, coming across as 'frantic' and 'hysterical' rather than genuinely funny. The acting is pretty terrible all-round. Campbell has a goofy self-confidence which enables him to nearly get away with it but the others simply look inept, their hopelessly amateurish efforts serving only to damage the film further. Evil Dead II will undoubtedly appeal to some, with its penchant for bad taste comedy and breakneck slapstick carnage.

There's a welcome vein of black humour (like the girlfriend's head in a vice), but it's really Campbell who makes it worth watching: he gives it all he's got as possibly the most abused character in cinema. At one point the poor guy sits down for a rest and his chair falls to pieces! Better than the first movie, then - but not exactly good.

    To put my reviews in better perspective I read the one star reviews posted and I am pretty much disgusted. Here are a few thing you need to know about this movie: This is a sequel, it is not unoriginal because it was one of the first movies in the gorefest genre, and it blends horror and comedy. Now onto the movie itself. This is in an everlasting battle for my favorite movie of all time, with the first Evil Dead of course. I have an extreme respect for this movie no matter how ridiculous it gets or how despised it is. In my opinion this is probably one of the easiest horror movies to watch because unlike most horror films it has a story, characters who can defend themselves, and breaks from the nonstop scares, which makes the scares even more effective. I loved this movie the first time I saw it and more than likely will love it to the day I die.

    I must say I never had time for the 'slice-up the helpless victims' genre of horror films, even though I spent most of the 90s working my way through the Friday 13th/Halloween films (Part6+Jason goes to Hell/Curse of Michael Myers my favourites because they break that mold). For that reason I never really cared much for The Evil Dead which fell very squarely into that genre but love, love, love Evil Dead 2 because it's so very different. It simply oozes imagination from every pore, the pace is relentless and the slapstick humour wonderfully relentless. No insult to the rest of the cast but a terrific performance from Bruce Campbell who without a shadow of a doubt owns this film (although a great deal of credit must go to Ted Rami who suffered horribly in his bodysuit as the witch in the cellar, the bit where he tips his head to the side only for all the sweat to drip out is much more horrific than any of the fake gore on screen). It's funny now to think that this was considered one of the 'video nasties' at the time of its' release, it looks so tame nowadays. Sure there's a lot of blood Shining style but the bodycount is in single figures, it's not at all sadistic and actually is pretty tongue-in-cheek and good humoured. A great thing about the DVD is the commentary, Bruce Campbell and Sam Rami are just wonderful with their comments, informative and funny as hell. Shame no Bob Tapert to complete the trio. All told an irreplaceable classic

    As a trilogy, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series doesn't really weigh up. The first film is an ultra low-budget  but quite suspensefully made  gore film, containing many genuinely unnerving moments thanks to its clever camera work and editing. The second and third films in the series change the tone and style completely, aiming instead for a cartoonishly over-the-top comedy feel  'slapstick gore' as it has been described in some circles, reminiscent of a Three Stooges movie except that it's full of dismemberment and other such bloody delights. If you're after a serious, genuinely scary style of film, then Part One is the one to watch. If you're after something spectacularly bloody yet simultaneously humorous, then numbers 2 and 3 fit the bill. For me, the original Evil Dead is a quintessential master-class in low budget horror-making skillful, tight, often very frightening. This sequel doesn't really work, showing too much affinity for its madcap gore and monsters. Evil Dead II has a much larger cult following than its predecessor but, at risk of upsetting this army of loyal fans, I'm going to stick my neck out and admit I really don't like it. Survivor of the original film Ash (Bruce Campbell) is unable to escape from the woodland cabin where he so recently endured the mother of all bad nights. Trapped for yet another evening, he prepares himself to endure more freakish horrors as the light begins to fade. He is joined by four outsiders  Annie (Sarah Berry), whose parents originally unleashed the demons in the cabin whilst researching the Book of the Dead; Ed (Richard Domeier), a professor who is also Annie's research partner and boyfriend; Jake (Dan Hicks), a white-trash handyman; and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva), Jake's air-headed trailer-trash girlfriend. The five inhabitants of the cabin are left to endure various spooky events, bloodthirsty demon attacks, bodily possessions/invasions, and so on and so forth, before they finally figure out a way to send the demons back from whence they came. Raimi's bigger budget proves a curse rather than a blessing here. He doesn't need to build up to the shock moments slowly and carefully this time around. If he requires an elaborate monster to pop up suddenly, then that is just what happens if he needs gallons of blood and bile to gush forth rather than a mere trickle, then gallons is what he gets. The unfortunate thing is that the original worked so well because Raimi had figured out that often less can be more  his slow and skillful build-ups created real intensity. That philosophy is completely dismissed here, as Raimi opts to throw a non-stop barrage of gross and gooey carnage at the viewer right from the start. There's still a degree of inventiveness on show, especially in the scene where Ash has to sever his own hand after it becomes possessed. The sight of his uncontrollable 'demon hand' smashing plates over his head and trying to gouge at his own face, not to mention dragging his unconscious body across the floor, is rather funny. Sadly, in other parts of the film much of the humour over-shoots the mark, coming across as 'frantic' and 'hysterical' rather than genuinely funny. The acting is pretty terrible all-round. Campbell has a goofy self-confidence which enables him to nearly get away with it but the others simply look inept, their hopelessly amateurish efforts serving only to damage the film further. Evil Dead II will undoubtedly appeal to some, with its penchant for bad taste comedy and breakneck slapstick carnage. However, if its outlandish sense of humour is not to your taste, you may find this a very long 84 minutes indeed.

    This one actually surpasses the original in just about every way. Out of the "Evil Dead" trilogy most people refer to "Evil Dead 2" for a reason. Two is basically what makes this trilogy stand out. This is probably the film that made Ash a iconic figure in the horror genre and probably made the chainsaw the iconic horror weapon. It's more crazy and humorous than before and has way more supernatural elements going on. In fact this time the whole cabin looks like it's been possessed. Bruce Campbell again plays Ash but he now feels like a trademark character in these genre. His facial expressions and his crazy laughs are a classic. Everything is just more humorous this time around in a good way. It just has many innovative elements which adds onto the originality from the first. This one is a classic for a reason and shouldn't be missed out on. Especially if your into the horror genre. 8.6/10

    This is a cabin on cocaine!! Ash returns for the role of Evil Dead 2 giving out his best performance yet!! Poor Ash is getting tormented by the demons messing with his mind and himself. Sam Ramini gives out more of his classic camera-work making this movie work how it should be. The woods running, the reversed footage, and gory effects. I loved how ED2 completely changed from a good straight up horror movie as ED1 to a comedy/horror. Its a perfect balance for the Evil Dead trilogy. Ash from becoming a wimp in ED1 to a hero in ED2. What kind of action star has a chainsaw connected to their hand and a their trusty boomstick... Ash of course!! And forever he will be one of the greatest horror icon. This movie will live on!

    Evil Dead II (1987): The Good, the Bad and the Heroic Synopsis: Classic "go to abandoned cabin in the woods and bad things happen" style of movie starring Bruce Campbell, who reprises his role as Ash Williams. Technically more of a reboot than a sequel, the movie follows Ash and his love interest back to the little cabin in the woods where another reading from "The Book of the Dead" makes things rather interesting for its new inhabitants. The Good: Honestly, if you can't watch this movie and have a freakin' blast doing so.... I don't know what is wrong with you. For starters, don't take yourself or the movie so seriously... life, and this movie, are better that way. Raimi takes the concept of the original film and sort of reboots it (which can be a little confusing upon first view). It's basically the original Evil Dead on steroids. The result is a MORE over-the-top version of the original where Ash is now solely in control of the screen time, which is a marvelous thing. It's almost like Raimi and his writers are sitting in a room thinking, "How much ridiculously awesome stuff can we throw on the screen? Okay, yeah... let's do all of this!". It's brilliant. He leaves nothing on the table and the result is a wild, wacky movie with a frenetic pace. You just have no idea where he is going to take you next and it's a hoot. Also, the fact that he centers the movie around Bruce Campbell was a wise decision and ultimately makes it comparable to the original. If a different casting decision is made, this one is likely forgotten and Army of Darkness never happens. The Bad: Well, the fact that it's basically a retelling of the original story (or maybe "re-imagined" is a better way of saying it) is a cop out of sorts. Most would think a sequel (thus the name of "Evil Dead II") would pick up where we all left off. But no, Raimi instead revisits old stomping grounds. If he had failed to come up with new ideas, this would be a big problem, but thankfully, the acting of Campbell and the wild imagination of Raimi save this movie and honestly, make it very comparable in quality to the original - which from me, is high praise for the sequel. Some of the effects are tad out of date, sure... but the fact that the film is a little more black comedy versus straight-up horror helps the film date a little better. The characters not named "Ash" are pretty boring as well. Or maybe it is just that they are overshadowed by Campbell's performance. Either way, this tends to bog down the later parts of the movie a bit. The Heroic: Speaking of Campbell's performance... it is one of the all-time greats. In a vacuum of performances, Campbell's is truly Oscar-worthy, which many might think is a ridiculous thought. Still, I can't think of a single other "A-lister" that could do what he did and bring more value within the confines of what this movie is. In fact, Bruce Campbell IS the movie! Watching him slowly go insane is one of cinema's true pleasures. Campbell lays it all on the line and not for a minute does he disappoint. His catapult to cult status is no coincidence. It was well earned.

    Just finished watching Evil Dead II and it certainly delivers the goods! I found this sequel very entertaining, funny and original, but at the same time a bit less scary and disturbing than the first one. There are a lot of memorable scenes where crazy stuff happens to poor Ash, who had already suffered a lot in the first film. Speaking of which, Bruce Campbell is totally insane here and I appreciated his over the top performance, making his character much more interesting this time. Also, the practical effects are more polished and improved. Maybe it's just me, but I actually found the ones used in the The Evil Dead I more effective. I can't really say which one is my favorite so far since they are very distinct from each other and are both great. Now I will be heading to Army of Darkness, which appears to be one hell of a ride too.

    While Sam Raimi did base the first Evil Dead movie on his short movie "Within the woods" (a short a lot of people would love to see someday, but there are some issues with it, either rights issues or the material is not good enough, I guess), this is a sequel/remake of the first one. It seems like he was ahead of his time. We do get a "previously on Evil Dead" segment in the beginning, but it doesn't show the events that unfold as they were portrayed in the previous movie. It's like a short movie that changes the back-story a little bit. It also is a bit funnier than the first movie. Bruce Campbell is more than able to squeeze funny out of some situations. So while it seems like more of the same it is still more than entertaining.

    Evil Dead 2 has been my favorite movie for a long time now, but recently I started to think it may not be as great as I remember it from 6 months ago. So I gave it a re-watch to see if it still holds up. The movies plot is very simple, people trapped in a cabin while demons attack them, seams simple enough, but the crazy stuff that the demons do to the people make this movie immensely entertaining. The hero of the movie is Ash, and he's already survived the first Evil Dead and now he's the only survivor. but later on the owners of the cabin return to it and then they all need to fight to stay alive. The movies writing felt very natural in the way the people talked and interacted with another, but that doesn't mean it's without it's campy one-liners. The campy one- liners are all memorable and don't hold the movie back, if anything it helps the movie. Now the main thing about the movie that holds your attention is that you have no idea whats going to be thrown at our protagonist next. It could be trees attacking the cabin, your own hand getting possessed, or an eye popping out of a skull and into someones mouth, all this zaniness really keeps your attention and makes the movie very fast paced and enjoyable. The main character of Ash is one of my favorite movie character's ever because of Bruce Campbell's performance, he's able to do serious acting when needed and at the same time he's able to be campy when needed. Whats surprising for the type of movie this is, is how good the camera work is. You get so many shots at many different things that are all edited together perfectly. But the movies biggest strength would be most other movie's biggest weakness, and that is the flaws in the movie, the little imperfections. These imperfections work in the favor of the movies campyness and they make the movie perfect because you can tell that everyone working on the movie put there best effort into it. It showed that they didn't make the movie to make money, they made it to make an enjoyable camp filled horror comedy that will stand the test of time. So does this movie still remain at the top for me? Yes it does. It stays at the top for it's enjoyment, horror, comedy, camp, and all around the inspiration factor that says "make your own movie to just make a movie" my rating 10 out of 10. In the words of Roger Ebert the movie is "Manic, inspired genius. A great time!" and in my own words "It's the most original, and entertaining horror film ever made"
