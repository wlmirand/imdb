    This is basically a film with no weaknesses. A couple of important points: First, I have seen a few reviews of the film complaining about the fire scene. Spoilers ahead: That scene is brilliant and necessary because Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) showed Alberto Aragon (Giancarlo Giannini), that he has what it takes to follow in his footsteps to not only run the winery, but to make it even better (Which is what the last scene in the film shows). The fire essentially was a cleansing agent, erasing the old and bringing in the new. Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn (Who did the best acting job in the film)), knew that Paul had what it takes to run things which is why he said to Paul "I have faith in you and my son." This point is critical because he knew Pedro Jr (Freddy Rodriguez), had no interest in running the business, thus, only Paul had what it took to keep the business going after Alberto passed on. At the end, Alberto realizes what kind of man Paul is, and says to Paul: "This is your family, and this is your roots." Paul honestly does not know what to do, but Alberto tells Victoria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (Who is a knockout to say the least)), to "Go to your husband." I have also seen critics complain about Paul leaving his wife Betty (Debra Sutton), for Victoria. If I came back from the War, and saw my wife in bed with another man, I would not want anything to do with her either. One more point about Paul he was perfect for Victoria, because of the way he carried himself: He was tortured by what happened to him in the war, then walks in his home to see what Betty did (And walks away, instead of hitting him, her, or both), yet was willing to help a total stranger (Victoria) who is terrified of her father, when they met on a bus. He finally learned to not only love Victoria, but the entire Aragon way of life, and essentially embraced being an Aragon. Which is a life far better than the world he came from (Including being raised in an orphanage). It is interesting that it is something Pedro Jr and to a lesser extent, Victoria did not want. Next the scenery is incredible. Particularly the scene with the women crushing the grapes with their feet. There are so many themes in this film it is not funny: Love, honor, responsibility, decency, acceptance, change & renewal to name a few. Do I love this movie? You better believe it (Not to mention who would not want Victoria? (But that is another issue)). Flawless film and an easy 10/10 stars.

    Paul Sutton (Reeves) comes back from the war (WWII) to find his new bride is not waiting for him. Going back to work as a travelling chocolate salesman, he gets tied up with the Aragon family; a historic Mexican family who have a large and beautiful vineyard. It is their daughter Victoria that is the draw for Sutton. The story is rather special, though not entirely unpredictable, and is a rather nice backdrop to give Reeves the opportunity to play the engaging, gentlemanly, perfect but troubled veteran in this gentle drama. The scenery of the Aragon vineyard is beautiful, although I believe a lot of it is CGI, and the Aragon family are varied and demonstrate the rich tapestry of family life from the overbearing father Giancarlo Gianinni, the wise and strong mother Angelica Aragon and the irrepressible patriarch Anthony Quinn, who provides some lovely touching and funny moments. It is good to note at this point that - in light of one of those funny moments Reeves CAN sing, and the out of tune serenading of Victoria is acting! This film is what it is, a romance film, a stunningly beautiful production, well directed and with a good script. There are some moments of real tenderness and joy, and it says something about young men's experience of war and how they are left to cope with it alone. Genius it isn't, or groundbreaking, but it's really nice pretty picture indicative of the big studio star vehicle films of the time it is depicting.

    Reeves plays a GI back from the war who crosses paths with a young Hispanic woman on her way home, having been impregnated by one of her professors. She is convinced her old-world father will kill her, so the soldier offers to pose as her husband for one day. Of course, they quickly fall for each other, but this is complicated by the tyrannical father's hatred of this gringo, and the fact that the soldier is actually married to someone else. Beautifully photographed with a great musical score, this oddball romance should appeal to most females and sensitive males. Reeves and his costar, whose name I can't spell, are wonderful together. Giannini makes a great dastardly dad, and Quinn does his Zorba routine as the loving grandpa and family patriarch. The whole thing plays out like a fairy tale, sort of like "Pretty Woman." Which is to say, you won't believe it for one minute but you go along with it. And be prepared: The ending of this leisurely paced film is rather abrupt. An American director would have done a bit more, and staged a lavish wedding.

    There are a few scenes in this love story which will bring out a few chuckles, but all in all this is a film about family, love, and joy. Keanu Reeves portrays the orphan Paul Sutton, a man who has fought to be acknowledged all his life and has returned a decorated war hero and a young man in search of himself. He has had a lot of time to think about who he is and what he wants to be. He and Debra Messing portray an often ignored segment of the American post war population, the ones who got married on the spur of the moment and were separated for four years during the war. They grew apart, and hardly know one another. So when Paul meets Victoria, he is pursuing a path unknown, a path beyond the dreams he made in his mind while separated from Betty. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon portrays the woman "in trouble", which at that time being pregnant out of wedlock was nearly cause for public stoning, and especially in a strict Roman Catholic family. Her performance, along with the stellar performances of Anthony Quinn as Victoria's grandfather and Giancarlo Giannini as Victoria's father, make this romance a stunning piece of true romance. Every scene, every nuance of the film presses you deeper and deeper into the feelings of the characters, and the scenery and photography are incredibly breathtaking. Rated PG-13 for sexual themes and war scenes, this is a film for Date Night with your significant other. Collectible, absolutely, if for no other reason than to have evidence of Keanu's occasional good sense in accepting a role.

    I saw this film when it first opened many years ago, and liked it a lot. It's a film that can be enjoyed both on the big and small screen; the former to revel in the gorgeous cinematography while the latter because of its intimate story. The lush music score adds to the glorious work overall. Where were all the Oscar nominations?!? Anyway, i watched it again the other day on TV and that rekindled my passion for this movie. People like to unjustly dumb-down Keanu Reeves; all i want to say is Keanu has not allowed himself to be typecast. He has done comedy (Bill & Ted, Parenthood, Something's Gotta Give); romance (Walk in the Clouds, Sweet November, The Lake House); drama (River's Edge, Devil's Advocate); action (Speed, Matrix, Chain Reaction), and Shakespeare (Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing). I really can't think of a more canny actor.

    while the age of the technology has drastically changed from the time this film was first released, the principles and values remained unchallenged and firm. Love conquers all. Understandtably, the values of a family as shown by the ARAGON's is a true reflection of a God-loving people. . . more so, the second generation father had made it clear to provide the needed security of the future for his family, his children and the next generation to come but failed to show them when at the most needed time when his daughter returned from city pregnant without a true father. At the end of the day, realization takes place and made it best for all to be at peace with himself and the people they dearly loved. I would always recommend this film as its message could cross boundaries, time-lines and generations.

    A Walk In The Clouds is a lovely and unabashedly romantic film with gorgeous cinematography and a strong cast. Keanu Reeves is authentic as the orphan soldier who tries to help the beautiful daughter of a well-established Spanish family that owns a vineyard and winery in Northern California. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon plays Victoria with heart and sensitivity, and she and Keanu seem like a couple from the moment they meet. Anthony Quinn, who plays her grandfather steals every scene he's in with his charming performance. Keanu and Anthony have great chemistry together, and look like they could be related since they are similar in their height and build, their noses and even their face shapes! Although it came out in 1995, it holds up visually, since it takes place after WWII. The production values, sets, costumes, and hairstyles are appropriate for the time period. I heartily recommend this for all die-hard romantics! And lastly - Roger Ebert liked it, 'nuff said!

    When you put Anthony Quinn and Giancarlo Giannini together, you expect some magic. These are two GIANTS of the screen from Europe who have put together some of the most memorable performances on film. I think they could read the dictionary and make it sound important. Poor Keanu Reeves. His scenes with these two cinematic giants just showed how really out of his depth he was. He seems like an earnest guy, and he has found some roles that suit him, (The Matrix series.) but this was WAY over his head. If they had found someone else for the role, I think they could have pulled it off. That and..... The end? REALLY?! The story was quite a stretch from the start, but I felt like they kept it moving along, and there were some well written scenes. But when they set everything on fire at the end, it was just dumb and ridiculous. I will say this is one of the prettiest movies you will ever see. It's a bit spoiled by too much CGI and enhanced trickery. My guess is they got tired of waiting for nature to come up with some beautiful sunsets for them. But the rest of the cinematography is really good. For romantics only. (And REALLY big Keanu fans!)

    In terms of what "A Walk in the Clouds" does right and wrong, it's like "Memoirs of a Geisha," a dissimilar romance that came out a decade later. The acting is great. The cinematography is breathtaking. The film works with pure magic. But there's a big problem: the screenplay is terrible. Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) is a war hero returning from the Pacific to be reunited with a girl he married "just so I could have someone to write to" (Debra Messing). Realizing that he's entered into a nightmare, he resumes his job as a chocolate salesman. On a bus to Sacremento for his job, he meets Victoria Aragon (Aitana Sanchez-Guijon), a Mexican beauty who is pregnant and unmarried. This would be troubling for anyone, but Victoria's father, Alberto (Giancarlo Giannini) is so traditional he makes Jerry Falwell look positively liberal. Because Paul is such a nice guy, he agrees to pose as her husband for a day, then leave her, which would hopefully solve the problem. Of course, they fall in love, which makes the situation even more complicated. The acting is solid. Many people give Keanu Reeves a hard time about his performances, and that's a little unfair. True, he's no Sean Penn, and I doubt that anyone will mention his name and "Oscar" in the same sentence any time soon, but given the right role, he can be effective. This was true of "Speed," "The Matrix," and "The Devil's Advocate," which I consider his best performance. "A Walk in the Clouds" should be among that list. It's easily the weakest of the three, but his performance is not. Paul is so immensely likable that it would turn the movie into a case of sugar shock, except that Reeves keeps Paul so genuine that it is impossible to not like him. His co-star, Aitana Sanchez-Guijon, is solid, although their chemistry is more of the "great friends" variety, not "star-crossed lovers." The other main actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Anthony Quinn, are excellent. Giannini is Oscar-worthy as Alberto. He's rigidly traditional, but it's his love of his family that makes him so. Ironically, however, it makes him blind to the needs of others. His father, Don Pedro (Quinn), is like the rest of his family: wise and more open. He always on hand to give advice on love and marriage to the would-be husband. He is also present in a hilarious scene where he gets Paul (and himself) very drunk and has him sing a traditional Mexican courting song outside Victoria's window. Alfonso Arau made the art-house hit, "Like Water for Chocolate," a film that I haven't seen, but is in my Netflix queue (and has been for some time). The middle part is magic, and it's Arau's talent that speaks to that. Unfortunately, the beginning is clunky, and the ending is completely over-the-top. Not all of this can be blamed on Arau, however. It's his first mainstream American film, so he was probably forced to make some concessions at the behest of the producers. However, even they should have realized that some of the lines needed to be rewritten. Overall, it works, but not as well as you'd hope.

    Believe it or not, I was even laughing at some of the scenes in this film which has the most beautiful musical score imaginable. The scene with the family trampling on the grapes vividly reminded me of Lucille Ball doing the same thing on her famous television show. The scene where Keanu Reeves comes home from World War 11 to an unfaithful wife brought me back to Dana Andrews and Virginia Mayo in "The Best Years of Our Lives." Giancarlo Giannini is the distrusting drunkard of a father here. His daughter, unmarried and pregnant, returns home and on the road finds Keanu Reeves, a chocolate salesman and recent war hero. Reeves agrees to pretend that he is wed to the young lady. Giannini immediately takes a dislike to Reeves as he doesn't trust him and his cynical regarding his daughter's relationship. In a drunken fit, he accidentally sets the wine valley ablaze. Of course, Reeves pulls out a root which shows no damage. His pulling it out reminded me of Vivien Leigh clutching the soil in "Gone With the Wind." Again, I laughed. Anthony Quinn played the elderly grandfather who is philosophical and wise. Had he been 20 years younger, he would have had the Giannini part.

It's a bit spoiled by too much CGI and enhanced trickery. My guess is they got tired of waiting for nature to come up with some beautiful sunsets for them. But the rest of the cinematography is really good. For romantics only. (And REALLY big Keanu fans!)

    In terms of what "A Walk in the Clouds" does right and wrong, it's like "Memoirs of a Geisha," a dissimilar romance that came out a decade later. The acting is great. The cinematography is breathtaking. The film works with pure magic. But there's a big problem: the screenplay is terrible. Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) is a war hero returning from the Pacific to be reunited with a girl he married "just so I could have someone to write to" (Debra Messing). Realizing that he's entered into a nightmare, he resumes his job as a chocolate salesman. On a bus to Sacremento for his job, he meets Victoria Aragon (Aitana Sanchez-Guijon), a Mexican beauty who is pregnant and unmarried. This would be troubling for anyone, but Victoria's father, Alberto (Giancarlo Giannini) is so traditional he makes Jerry Falwell look positively liberal. Because Paul is such a nice guy, he agrees to pose as her husband for a day, then leave her, which would hopefully solve the problem. Of course, they fall in love, which makes the situation even more complicated. The acting is solid. Many people give Keanu Reeves a hard time about his performances, and that's a little unfair. True, he's no Sean Penn, and I doubt that anyone will mention his name and "Oscar" in the same sentence any time soon, but given the right role, he can be effective. This was true of "Speed," "The Matrix," and "The Devil's Advocate," which I consider his best performance. "A Walk in the Clouds" should be among that list. It's easily the weakest of the three, but his performance is not. Paul is so immensely likable that it would turn the movie into a case of sugar shock, except that Reeves keeps Paul so genuine that it is impossible to not like him. His co-star, Aitana Sanchez-Guijon, is solid, although their chemistry is more of the "great friends" variety, not "star-crossed lovers." The other main actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Anthony Quinn, are excellent. Giannini is Oscar-worthy as Alberto. He's rigidly traditional, but it's his love of his family that makes him so. Ironically, however, it makes him blind to the needs of others. His father, Don Pedro (Quinn), is like the rest of his family: wise and more open. He always on hand to give advice on love and marriage to the would-be husband. He is also present in a hilarious scene where he gets Paul (and himself) very drunk and has him sing a traditional Mexican courting song outside Victoria's window. Alfonso Arau made the art-house hit, "Like Water for Chocolate," a film that I haven't seen, but is in my Netflix queue (and has been for some time). The middle part is magic, and it's Arau's talent that speaks to that. Unfortunately, the beginning is clunky, and the ending is completely over-the-top. Not all of this can be blamed on Arau, however. It's his first mainstream American film, so he was probably forced to make some concessions at the behest of the producers. However, even they should have realized that some of the lines needed to be rewritten. Overall, it works, but not as well as you'd hope.

    Believe it or not, I was even laughing at some of the scenes in this film which has the most beautiful musical score imaginable. The scene with the family trampling on the grapes vividly reminded me of Lucille Ball doing the same thing on her famous television show. The scene where Keanu Reeves comes home from World War 11 to an unfaithful wife brought me back to Dana Andrews and Virginia Mayo in "The Best Years of Our Lives." Giancarlo Giannini is the distrusting drunkard of a father here. His daughter, unmarried and pregnant, returns home and on the road finds Keanu Reeves, a chocolate salesman and recent war hero. Reeves agrees to pretend that he is wed to the young lady. Giannini immediately takes a dislike to Reeves as he doesn't trust him and his cynical regarding his daughter's relationship. In a drunken fit, he accidentally sets the wine valley ablaze. Of course, Reeves pulls out a root which shows no damage. His pulling it out reminded me of Vivien Leigh clutching the soil in "Gone With the Wind." Again, I laughed. Anthony Quinn played the elderly grandfather who is philosophical and wise. Had he been 20 years younger, he would have had the Giannini part.

    This is basically a film with no weaknesses. A couple of important points: First, I have seen a few reviews of the film complaining about the fire scene. Spoilers ahead: That scene is brilliant and necessary because Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) showed Alberto Aragon (Giancarlo Giannini), that he has what it takes to follow in his footsteps to not only run the winery, but to make it even better (Which is what the last scene in the film shows). The fire essentially was a cleansing agent, erasing the old and bringing in the new. Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn (Who did the best acting job in the film)), knew that Paul had what it takes to run things which is why he said to Paul "I have faith in you and my son." This point is critical because he knew Pedro Jr (Freddy Rodriguez), had no interest in running the business, thus, only Paul had what it took to keep the business going after Alberto passed on. At the end, Alberto realizes what kind of man Paul is, and says to Paul: "This is your family, and this is your roots." Paul honestly does not know what to do, but Alberto tells Victoria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (Who is a knockout to say the least)), to "Go to your husband." I have also seen critics complain about Paul leaving his wife Betty (Debra Sutton), for Victoria. If I came back from the War, and saw my wife in bed with another man, I would not want anything to do with her either. One more point about Paul he was perfect for Victoria, because of the way he carried himself: He was tortured by what happened to him in the war, then walks in his home to see what Betty did (And walks away, instead of hitting him, her, or both), yet was willing to help a total stranger (Victoria) who is terrified of her father, when they met on a bus. He finally learned to not only love Victoria, but the entire Aragon way of life, and essentially embraced being an Aragon. Which is a life far better than the world he came from (Including being raised in an orphanage). It is interesting that it is something Pedro Jr and to a lesser extent, Victoria did not want. Next the scenery is incredible. Particularly the scene with the women crushing the grapes with their feet. There are so many themes in this film it is not funny: Love, honor, responsibility, decency, acceptance, change & renewal to name a few. Do I love this movie? You better believe it (Not to mention who would not want Victoria? (But that is another issue)). Flawless film and an easy 10/10 stars.

    Paul Sutton (Reeves) comes back from the war (WWII) to find his new bride is not waiting for him. Going back to work as a travelling chocolate salesman, he gets tied up with the Aragon family; a historic Mexican family who have a large and beautiful vineyard. It is their daughter Victoria that is the draw for Sutton. The story is rather special, though not entirely unpredictable, and is a rather nice backdrop to give Reeves the opportunity to play the engaging, gentlemanly, perfect but troubled veteran in this gentle drama. The scenery of the Aragon vineyard is beautiful, although I believe a lot of it is CGI, and the Aragon family are varied and demonstrate the rich tapestry of family life from the overbearing father Giancarlo Gianinni, the wise and strong mother Angelica Aragon and the irrepressible patriarch Anthony Quinn, who provides some lovely touching and funny moments. It is good to note at this point that - in light of one of those funny moments Reeves CAN sing, and the out of tune serenading of Victoria is acting! This film is what it is, a romance film, a stunningly beautiful production, well directed and with a good script. There are some moments of real tenderness and joy, and it says something about young men's experience of war and how they are left to cope with it alone. Genius it isn't, or groundbreaking, but it's really nice pretty picture indicative of the big studio star vehicle films of the time it is depicting.

    Reeves plays a GI back from the war who crosses paths with a young Hispanic woman on her way home, having been impregnated by one of her professors. She is convinced her old-world father will kill her, so the soldier offers to pose as her husband for one day. Of course, they quickly fall for each other, but this is complicated by the tyrannical father's hatred of this gringo, and the fact that the soldier is actually married to someone else. Beautifully photographed with a great musical score, this oddball romance should appeal to most females and sensitive males. Reeves and his costar, whose name I can't spell, are wonderful together. Giannini makes a great dastardly dad, and Quinn does his Zorba routine as the loving grandpa and family patriarch. The whole thing plays out like a fairy tale, sort of like "Pretty Woman." Which is to say, you won't believe it for one minute but you go along with it. And be prepared: The ending of this leisurely paced film is rather abrupt. An American director would have done a bit more, and staged a lavish wedding.

    There are a few scenes in this love story which will bring out a few chuckles, but all in all this is a film about family, love, and joy. Keanu Reeves portrays the orphan Paul Sutton, a man who has fought to be acknowledged all his life and has returned a decorated war hero and a young man in search of himself. He has had a lot of time to think about who he is and what he wants to be. He and Debra Messing portray an often ignored segment of the American post war population, the ones who got married on the spur of the moment and were separated for four years during the war. They grew apart, and hardly know one another. So when Paul meets Victoria, he is pursuing a path unknown, a path beyond the dreams he made in his mind while separated from Betty. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon portrays the woman "in trouble", which at that time being pregnant out of wedlock was nearly cause for public stoning, and especially in a strict Roman Catholic family. Her performance, along with the stellar performances of Anthony Quinn as Victoria's grandfather and Giancarlo Giannini as Victoria's father, make this romance a stunning piece of true romance. Every scene, every nuance of the film presses you deeper and deeper into the feelings of the characters, and the scenery and photography are incredibly breathtaking. Rated PG-13 for sexual themes and war scenes, this is a film for Date Night with your significant other. Collectible, absolutely, if for no other reason than to have evidence of Keanu's occasional good sense in accepting a role.

    I saw this film when it first opened many years ago, and liked it a lot. It's a film that can be enjoyed both on the big and small screen; the former to revel in the gorgeous cinematography while the latter because of its intimate story. The lush music score adds to the glorious work overall. Where were all the Oscar nominations?!? Anyway, i watched it again the other day on TV and that rekindled my passion for this movie. People like to unjustly dumb-down Keanu Reeves; all i want to say is Keanu has not allowed himself to be typecast. He has done comedy (Bill & Ted, Parenthood, Something's Gotta Give); romance (Walk in the Clouds, Sweet November, The Lake House); drama (River's Edge, Devil's Advocate); action (Speed, Matrix, Chain Reaction), and Shakespeare (Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing). I really can't think of a more canny actor.

    while the age of the technology has drastically changed from the time this film was first released, the principles and values remained unchallenged and firm. Love conquers all. Understandtably, the values of a family as shown by the ARAGON's is a true reflection of a God-loving people. . . more so, the second generation father had made it clear to provide the needed security of the future for his family, his children and the next generation to come but failed to show them when at the most needed time when his daughter returned from city pregnant without a true father. At the end of the day, realization takes place and made it best for all to be at peace with himself and the people they dearly loved. I would always recommend this film as its message could cross boundaries, time-lines and generations.

    A Walk In The Clouds is a lovely and unabashedly romantic film with gorgeous cinematography and a strong cast. Keanu Reeves is authentic as the orphan soldier who tries to help the beautiful daughter of a well-established Spanish family that owns a vineyard and winery in Northern California. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon plays Victoria with heart and sensitivity, and she and Keanu seem like a couple from the moment they meet. Anthony Quinn, who plays her grandfather steals every scene he's in with his charming performance. Keanu and Anthony have great chemistry together, and look like they could be related since they are similar in their height and build, their noses and even their face shapes! Although it came out in 1995, it holds up visually, since it takes place after WWII. The production values, sets, costumes, and hairstyles are appropriate for the time period. I heartily recommend this for all die-hard romantics! And lastly - Roger Ebert liked it, 'nuff said!

    When you put Anthony Quinn and Giancarlo Giannini together, you expect some magic. These are two GIANTS of the screen from Europe who have put together some of the most memorable performances on film. I think they could read the dictionary and make it sound important. Poor Keanu Reeves. His scenes with these two cinematic giants just showed how really out of his depth he was. He seems like an earnest guy, and he has found some roles that suit him, (The Matrix series.) but this was WAY over his head. If they had found someone else for the role, I think they could have pulled it off. That and..... The end? REALLY?! The story was quite a stretch from the start, but I felt like they kept it moving along, and there were some well written scenes. But when they set everything on fire at the end, it was just dumb and ridiculous. I will say this is one of the prettiest movies you will ever see. It's a bit spoiled by too much CGI and enhanced trickery. My guess is they got tired of waiting for nature to come up with some beautiful sunsets for them. But the rest of the cinematography is really good. For romantics only. (And REALLY big Keanu fans!)

Because Paul is such a nice guy, he agrees to pose as her husband for a day, then leave her, which would hopefully solve the problem. Of course, they fall in love, which makes the situation even more complicated. The acting is solid. Many people give Keanu Reeves a hard time about his performances, and that's a little unfair.

Not all of this can be blamed on Arau, however. It's his first mainstream American film, so he was probably forced to make some concessions at the behest of the producers. However, even they should have realized that some of the lines needed to be rewritten. Overall, it works, but not as well as you'd hope.

Understandtably, the values of a family as shown by the ARAGON's is a true reflection of a God-loving people. . . more so, the second generation father had made it clear to provide the needed security of the future for his family, his children and the next generation to come but failed to show them when at the most needed time when his daughter returned from city pregnant without a true father. At the end of the day, realization takes place and made it best for all to be at peace with himself and the people they dearly loved. I would always recommend this film as its message could cross boundaries, time-lines and generations.

    A Walk In The Clouds is a lovely and unabashedly romantic film with gorgeous cinematography and a strong cast. Keanu Reeves is authentic as the orphan soldier who tries to help the beautiful daughter of a well-established Spanish family that owns a vineyard and winery in Northern California. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon plays Victoria with heart and sensitivity, and she and Keanu seem like a couple from the moment they meet. Anthony Quinn, who plays her grandfather steals every scene he's in with his charming performance. Keanu and Anthony have great chemistry together, and look like they could be related since they are similar in their height and build, their noses and even their face shapes! Although it came out in 1995, it holds up visually, since it takes place after WWII. The production values, sets, costumes, and hairstyles are appropriate for the time period. I heartily recommend this for all die-hard romantics! And lastly - Roger Ebert liked it, 'nuff said!

    When you put Anthony Quinn and Giancarlo Giannini together, you expect some magic. These are two GIANTS of the screen from Europe who have put together some of the most memorable performances on film. I think they could read the dictionary and make it sound important. Poor Keanu Reeves. His scenes with these two cinematic giants just showed how really out of his depth he was. He seems like an earnest guy, and he has found some roles that suit him, (The Matrix series.) but this was WAY over his head. If they had found someone else for the role, I think they could have pulled it off. That and..... The end? REALLY?! The story was quite a stretch from the start, but I felt like they kept it moving along, and there were some well written scenes. But when they set everything on fire at the end, it was just dumb and ridiculous. I will say this is one of the prettiest movies you will ever see. It's a bit spoiled by too much CGI and enhanced trickery. My guess is they got tired of waiting for nature to come up with some beautiful sunsets for them. But the rest of the cinematography is really good. For romantics only. (And REALLY big Keanu fans!)

    In terms of what "A Walk in the Clouds" does right and wrong, it's like "Memoirs of a Geisha," a dissimilar romance that came out a decade later. The acting is great. The cinematography is breathtaking. The film works with pure magic. But there's a big problem: the screenplay is terrible. Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) is a war hero returning from the Pacific to be reunited with a girl he married "just so I could have someone to write to" (Debra Messing). Realizing that he's entered into a nightmare, he resumes his job as a chocolate salesman. On a bus to Sacremento for his job, he meets Victoria Aragon (Aitana Sanchez-Guijon), a Mexican beauty who is pregnant and unmarried. This would be troubling for anyone, but Victoria's father, Alberto (Giancarlo Giannini) is so traditional he makes Jerry Falwell look positively liberal. Because Paul is such a nice guy, he agrees to pose as her husband for a day, then leave her, which would hopefully solve the problem. Of course, they fall in love, which makes the situation even more complicated. The acting is solid. Many people give Keanu Reeves a hard time about his performances, and that's a little unfair. True, he's no Sean Penn, and I doubt that anyone will mention his name and "Oscar" in the same sentence any time soon, but given the right role, he can be effective. This was true of "Speed," "The Matrix," and "The Devil's Advocate," which I consider his best performance. "A Walk in the Clouds" should be among that list. It's easily the weakest of the three, but his performance is not. Paul is so immensely likable that it would turn the movie into a case of sugar shock, except that Reeves keeps Paul so genuine that it is impossible to not like him. His co-star, Aitana Sanchez-Guijon, is solid, although their chemistry is more of the "great friends" variety, not "star-crossed lovers." The other main actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Anthony Quinn, are excellent. Giannini is Oscar-worthy as Alberto. He's rigidly traditional, but it's his love of his family that makes him so. Ironically, however, it makes him blind to the needs of others. His father, Don Pedro (Quinn), is like the rest of his family: wise and more open. He always on hand to give advice on love and marriage to the would-be husband. He is also present in a hilarious scene where he gets Paul (and himself) very drunk and has him sing a traditional Mexican courting song outside Victoria's window. Alfonso Arau made the art-house hit, "Like Water for Chocolate," a film that I haven't seen, but is in my Netflix queue (and has been for some time). The middle part is magic, and it's Arau's talent that speaks to that. Unfortunately, the beginning is clunky, and the ending is completely over-the-top. Not all of this can be blamed on Arau, however. It's his first mainstream American film, so he was probably forced to make some concessions at the behest of the producers. However, even they should have realized that some of the lines needed to be rewritten. Overall, it works, but not as well as you'd hope.

    Believe it or not, I was even laughing at some of the scenes in this film which has the most beautiful musical score imaginable. The scene with the family trampling on the grapes vividly reminded me of Lucille Ball doing the same thing on her famous television show. The scene where Keanu Reeves comes home from World War 11 to an unfaithful wife brought me back to Dana Andrews and Virginia Mayo in "The Best Years of Our Lives." Giancarlo Giannini is the distrusting drunkard of a father here. His daughter, unmarried and pregnant, returns home and on the road finds Keanu Reeves, a chocolate salesman and recent war hero. Reeves agrees to pretend that he is wed to the young lady. Giannini immediately takes a dislike to Reeves as he doesn't trust him and his cynical regarding his daughter's relationship. In a drunken fit, he accidentally sets the wine valley ablaze. Of course, Reeves pulls out a root which shows no damage. His pulling it out reminded me of Vivien Leigh clutching the soil in "Gone With the Wind." Again, I laughed. Anthony Quinn played the elderly grandfather who is philosophical and wise. Had he been 20 years younger, he would have had the Giannini part.

    This is basically a film with no weaknesses. A couple of important points: First, I have seen a few reviews of the film complaining about the fire scene. Spoilers ahead: That scene is brilliant and necessary because Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) showed Alberto Aragon (Giancarlo Giannini), that he has what it takes to follow in his footsteps to not only run the winery, but to make it even better (Which is what the last scene in the film shows). The fire essentially was a cleansing agent, erasing the old and bringing in the new. Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn (Who did the best acting job in the film)), knew that Paul had what it takes to run things which is why he said to Paul "I have faith in you and my son." This point is critical because he knew Pedro Jr (Freddy Rodriguez), had no interest in running the business, thus, only Paul had what it took to keep the business going after Alberto passed on. At the end, Alberto realizes what kind of man Paul is, and says to Paul: "This is your family, and this is your roots." Paul honestly does not know what to do, but Alberto tells Victoria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (Who is a knockout to say the least)), to "Go to your husband." I have also seen critics complain about Paul leaving his wife Betty (Debra Sutton), for Victoria. If I came back from the War, and saw my wife in bed with another man, I would not want anything to do with her either. One more point about Paul he was perfect for Victoria, because of the way he carried himself: He was tortured by what happened to him in the war, then walks in his home to see what Betty did (And walks away, instead of hitting him, her, or both), yet was willing to help a total stranger (Victoria) who is terrified of her father, when they met on a bus. He finally learned to not only love Victoria, but the entire Aragon way of life, and essentially embraced being an Aragon. Which is a life far better than the world he came from (Including being raised in an orphanage). It is interesting that it is something Pedro Jr and to a lesser extent, Victoria did not want. Next the scenery is incredible. Particularly the scene with the women crushing the grapes with their feet. There are so many themes in this film it is not funny: Love, honor, responsibility, decency, acceptance, change & renewal to name a few. Do I love this movie? You better believe it (Not to mention who would not want Victoria? (But that is another issue)). Flawless film and an easy 10/10 stars.

    Paul Sutton (Reeves) comes back from the war (WWII) to find his new bride is not waiting for him. Going back to work as a travelling chocolate salesman, he gets tied up with the Aragon family; a historic Mexican family who have a large and beautiful vineyard. It is their daughter Victoria that is the draw for Sutton. The story is rather special, though not entirely unpredictable, and is a rather nice backdrop to give Reeves the opportunity to play the engaging, gentlemanly, perfect but troubled veteran in this gentle drama. The scenery of the Aragon vineyard is beautiful, although I believe a lot of it is CGI, and the Aragon family are varied and demonstrate the rich tapestry of family life from the overbearing father Giancarlo Gianinni, the wise and strong mother Angelica Aragon and the irrepressible patriarch Anthony Quinn, who provides some lovely touching and funny moments. It is good to note at this point that - in light of one of those funny moments Reeves CAN sing, and the out of tune serenading of Victoria is acting! This film is what it is, a romance film, a stunningly beautiful production, well directed and with a good script. There are some moments of real tenderness and joy, and it says something about young men's experience of war and how they are left to cope with it alone. Genius it isn't, or groundbreaking, but it's really nice pretty picture indicative of the big studio star vehicle films of the time it is depicting.

    Reeves plays a GI back from the war who crosses paths with a young Hispanic woman on her way home, having been impregnated by one of her professors. She is convinced her old-world father will kill her, so the soldier offers to pose as her husband for one day. Of course, they quickly fall for each other, but this is complicated by the tyrannical father's hatred of this gringo, and the fact that the soldier is actually married to someone else. Beautifully photographed with a great musical score, this oddball romance should appeal to most females and sensitive males. Reeves and his costar, whose name I can't spell, are wonderful together. Giannini makes a great dastardly dad, and Quinn does his Zorba routine as the loving grandpa and family patriarch. The whole thing plays out like a fairy tale, sort of like "Pretty Woman." Which is to say, you won't believe it for one minute but you go along with it. And be prepared: The ending of this leisurely paced film is rather abrupt. An American director would have done a bit more, and staged a lavish wedding.

    There are a few scenes in this love story which will bring out a few chuckles, but all in all this is a film about family, love, and joy. Keanu Reeves portrays the orphan Paul Sutton, a man who has fought to be acknowledged all his life and has returned a decorated war hero and a young man in search of himself. He has had a lot of time to think about who he is and what he wants to be. He and Debra Messing portray an often ignored segment of the American post war population, the ones who got married on the spur of the moment and were separated for four years during the war. They grew apart, and hardly know one another. So when Paul meets Victoria, he is pursuing a path unknown, a path beyond the dreams he made in his mind while separated from Betty. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon portrays the woman "in trouble", which at that time being pregnant out of wedlock was nearly cause for public stoning, and especially in a strict Roman Catholic family. Her performance, along with the stellar performances of Anthony Quinn as Victoria's grandfather and Giancarlo Giannini as Victoria's father, make this romance a stunning piece of true romance. Every scene, every nuance of the film presses you deeper and deeper into the feelings of the characters, and the scenery and photography are incredibly breathtaking. Rated PG-13 for sexual themes and war scenes, this is a film for Date Night with your significant other. Collectible, absolutely, if for no other reason than to have evidence of Keanu's occasional good sense in accepting a role.

    I saw this film when it first opened many years ago, and liked it a lot. It's a film that can be enjoyed both on the big and small screen; the former to revel in the gorgeous cinematography while the latter because of its intimate story. The lush music score adds to the glorious work overall. Where were all the Oscar nominations?!? Anyway, i watched it again the other day on TV and that rekindled my passion for this movie. People like to unjustly dumb-down Keanu Reeves; all i want to say is Keanu has not allowed himself to be typecast. He has done comedy (Bill & Ted, Parenthood, Something's Gotta Give); romance (Walk in the Clouds, Sweet November, The Lake House); drama (River's Edge, Devil's Advocate); action (Speed, Matrix, Chain Reaction), and Shakespeare (Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing). I really can't think of a more canny actor.

Keanu Reeves portrays the orphan Paul Sutton, a man who has fought to be acknowledged all his life and has returned a decorated war hero and a young man in search of himself. He has had a lot of time to think about who he is and what he wants to be. He and Debra Messing portray an often ignored segment of the American post war population, the ones who got married on the spur of the moment and were separated for four years during the war. They grew apart, and hardly know one another. So when Paul meets Victoria, he is pursuing a path unknown, a path beyond the dreams he made in his mind while separated from Betty. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon portrays the woman "in trouble", which at that time being pregnant out of wedlock was nearly cause for public stoning, and especially in a strict Roman Catholic family. Her performance, along with the stellar performances of Anthony Quinn as Victoria's grandfather and Giancarlo Giannini as Victoria's father, make this romance a stunning piece of true romance. Every scene, every nuance of the film presses you deeper and deeper into the feelings of the characters, and the scenery and photography are incredibly breathtaking. Rated PG-13 for sexual themes and war scenes, this is a film for Date Night with your significant other. Collectible, absolutely, if for no other reason than to have evidence of Keanu's occasional good sense in accepting a role.

    I saw this film when it first opened many years ago, and liked it a lot. It's a film that can be enjoyed both on the big and small screen; the former to revel in the gorgeous cinematography while the latter because of its intimate story. The lush music score adds to the glorious work overall. Where were all the Oscar nominations?!? Anyway, i watched it again the other day on TV and that rekindled my passion for this movie. People like to unjustly dumb-down Keanu Reeves; all i want to say is Keanu has not allowed himself to be typecast. He has done comedy (Bill & Ted, Parenthood, Something's Gotta Give); romance (Walk in the Clouds, Sweet November, The Lake House); drama (River's Edge, Devil's Advocate); action (Speed, Matrix, Chain Reaction), and Shakespeare (Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing). I really can't think of a more canny actor.

    while the age of the technology has drastically changed from the time this film was first released, the principles and values remained unchallenged and firm. Love conquers all. Understandtably, the values of a family as shown by the ARAGON's is a true reflection of a God-loving people. . . more so, the second generation father had made it clear to provide the needed security of the future for his family, his children and the next generation to come but failed to show them when at the most needed time when his daughter returned from city pregnant without a true father. At the end of the day, realization takes place and made it best for all to be at peace with himself and the people they dearly loved. I would always recommend this film as its message could cross boundaries, time-lines and generations.

    A Walk In The Clouds is a lovely and unabashedly romantic film with gorgeous cinematography and a strong cast. Keanu Reeves is authentic as the orphan soldier who tries to help the beautiful daughter of a well-established Spanish family that owns a vineyard and winery in Northern California. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon plays Victoria with heart and sensitivity, and she and Keanu seem like a couple from the moment they meet. Anthony Quinn, who plays her grandfather steals every scene he's in with his charming performance. Keanu and Anthony have great chemistry together, and look like they could be related since they are similar in their height and build, their noses and even their face shapes! Although it came out in 1995, it holds up visually, since it takes place after WWII. The production values, sets, costumes, and hairstyles are appropriate for the time period. I heartily recommend this for all die-hard romantics! And lastly - Roger Ebert liked it, 'nuff said!

    When you put Anthony Quinn and Giancarlo Giannini together, you expect some magic. These are two GIANTS of the screen from Europe who have put together some of the most memorable performances on film. I think they could read the dictionary and make it sound important. Poor Keanu Reeves. His scenes with these two cinematic giants just showed how really out of his depth he was. He seems like an earnest guy, and he has found some roles that suit him, (The Matrix series.) but this was WAY over his head. If they had found someone else for the role, I think they could have pulled it off. That and..... The end? REALLY?! The story was quite a stretch from the start, but I felt like they kept it moving along, and there were some well written scenes. But when they set everything on fire at the end, it was just dumb and ridiculous. I will say this is one of the prettiest movies you will ever see. It's a bit spoiled by too much CGI and enhanced trickery. My guess is they got tired of waiting for nature to come up with some beautiful sunsets for them. But the rest of the cinematography is really good. For romantics only. (And REALLY big Keanu fans!)

    In terms of what "A Walk in the Clouds" does right and wrong, it's like "Memoirs of a Geisha," a dissimilar romance that came out a decade later. The acting is great. The cinematography is breathtaking. The film works with pure magic. But there's a big problem: the screenplay is terrible. Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) is a war hero returning from the Pacific to be reunited with a girl he married "just so I could have someone to write to" (Debra Messing). Realizing that he's entered into a nightmare, he resumes his job as a chocolate salesman. On a bus to Sacremento for his job, he meets Victoria Aragon (Aitana Sanchez-Guijon), a Mexican beauty who is pregnant and unmarried. This would be troubling for anyone, but Victoria's father, Alberto (Giancarlo Giannini) is so traditional he makes Jerry Falwell look positively liberal. Because Paul is such a nice guy, he agrees to pose as her husband for a day, then leave her, which would hopefully solve the problem. Of course, they fall in love, which makes the situation even more complicated. The acting is solid. Many people give Keanu Reeves a hard time about his performances, and that's a little unfair. True, he's no Sean Penn, and I doubt that anyone will mention his name and "Oscar" in the same sentence any time soon, but given the right role, he can be effective. This was true of "Speed," "The Matrix," and "The Devil's Advocate," which I consider his best performance. "A Walk in the Clouds" should be among that list. It's easily the weakest of the three, but his performance is not. Paul is so immensely likable that it would turn the movie into a case of sugar shock, except that Reeves keeps Paul so genuine that it is impossible to not like him. His co-star, Aitana Sanchez-Guijon, is solid, although their chemistry is more of the "great friends" variety, not "star-crossed lovers." The other main actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Anthony Quinn, are excellent. Giannini is Oscar-worthy as Alberto. He's rigidly traditional, but it's his love of his family that makes him so. Ironically, however, it makes him blind to the needs of others. His father, Don Pedro (Quinn), is like the rest of his family: wise and more open. He always on hand to give advice on love and marriage to the would-be husband. He is also present in a hilarious scene where he gets Paul (and himself) very drunk and has him sing a traditional Mexican courting song outside Victoria's window. Alfonso Arau made the art-house hit, "Like Water for Chocolate," a film that I haven't seen, but is in my Netflix queue (and has been for some time). The middle part is magic, and it's Arau's talent that speaks to that. Unfortunately, the beginning is clunky, and the ending is completely over-the-top. Not all of this can be blamed on Arau, however. It's his first mainstream American film, so he was probably forced to make some concessions at the behest of the producers. However, even they should have realized that some of the lines needed to be rewritten. Overall, it works, but not as well as you'd hope.

    Believe it or not, I was even laughing at some of the scenes in this film which has the most beautiful musical score imaginable. The scene with the family trampling on the grapes vividly reminded me of Lucille Ball doing the same thing on her famous television show. The scene where Keanu Reeves comes home from World War 11 to an unfaithful wife brought me back to Dana Andrews and Virginia Mayo in "The Best Years of Our Lives." Giancarlo Giannini is the distrusting drunkard of a father here. His daughter, unmarried and pregnant, returns home and on the road finds Keanu Reeves, a chocolate salesman and recent war hero. Reeves agrees to pretend that he is wed to the young lady. Giannini immediately takes a dislike to Reeves as he doesn't trust him and his cynical regarding his daughter's relationship. In a drunken fit, he accidentally sets the wine valley ablaze. Of course, Reeves pulls out a root which shows no damage. His pulling it out reminded me of Vivien Leigh clutching the soil in "Gone With the Wind." Again, I laughed. Anthony Quinn played the elderly grandfather who is philosophical and wise. Had he been 20 years younger, he would have had the Giannini part.

    This is basically a film with no weaknesses. A couple of important points: First, I have seen a few reviews of the film complaining about the fire scene. Spoilers ahead: That scene is brilliant and necessary because Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) showed Alberto Aragon (Giancarlo Giannini), that he has what it takes to follow in his footsteps to not only run the winery, but to make it even better (Which is what the last scene in the film shows). The fire essentially was a cleansing agent, erasing the old and bringing in the new. Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn (Who did the best acting job in the film)), knew that Paul had what it takes to run things which is why he said to Paul "I have faith in you and my son." This point is critical because he knew Pedro Jr (Freddy Rodriguez), had no interest in running the business, thus, only Paul had what it took to keep the business going after Alberto passed on. At the end, Alberto realizes what kind of man Paul is, and says to Paul: "This is your family, and this is your roots." Paul honestly does not know what to do, but Alberto tells Victoria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (Who is a knockout to say the least)), to "Go to your husband." I have also seen critics complain about Paul leaving his wife Betty (Debra Sutton), for Victoria. If I came back from the War, and saw my wife in bed with another man, I would not want anything to do with her either. One more point about Paul he was perfect for Victoria, because of the way he carried himself: He was tortured by what happened to him in the war, then walks in his home to see what Betty did (And walks away, instead of hitting him, her, or both), yet was willing to help a total stranger (Victoria) who is terrified of her father, when they met on a bus. He finally learned to not only love Victoria, but the entire Aragon way of life, and essentially embraced being an Aragon. Which is a life far better than the world he came from (Including being raised in an orphanage). It is interesting that it is something Pedro Jr and to a lesser extent, Victoria did not want. Next the scenery is incredible. Particularly the scene with the women crushing the grapes with their feet. There are so many themes in this film it is not funny: Love, honor, responsibility, decency, acceptance, change & renewal to name a few. Do I love this movie? You better believe it (Not to mention who would not want Victoria? (But that is another issue)). Flawless film and an easy 10/10 stars.

    Paul Sutton (Reeves) comes back from the war (WWII) to find his new bride is not waiting for him. Going back to work as a travelling chocolate salesman, he gets tied up with the Aragon family; a historic Mexican family who have a large and beautiful vineyard. It is their daughter Victoria that is the draw for Sutton. The story is rather special, though not entirely unpredictable, and is a rather nice backdrop to give Reeves the opportunity to play the engaging, gentlemanly, perfect but troubled veteran in this gentle drama. The scenery of the Aragon vineyard is beautiful, although I believe a lot of it is CGI, and the Aragon family are varied and demonstrate the rich tapestry of family life from the overbearing father Giancarlo Gianinni, the wise and strong mother Angelica Aragon and the irrepressible patriarch Anthony Quinn, who provides some lovely touching and funny moments. It is good to note at this point that - in light of one of those funny moments Reeves CAN sing, and the out of tune serenading of Victoria is acting! This film is what it is, a romance film, a stunningly beautiful production, well directed and with a good script. There are some moments of real tenderness and joy, and it says something about young men's experience of war and how they are left to cope with it alone. Genius it isn't, or groundbreaking, but it's really nice pretty picture indicative of the big studio star vehicle films of the time it is depicting.

    Reeves plays a GI back from the war who crosses paths with a young Hispanic woman on her way home, having been impregnated by one of her professors. She is convinced her old-world father will kill her, so the soldier offers to pose as her husband for one day. Of course, they quickly fall for each other, but this is complicated by the tyrannical father's hatred of this gringo, and the fact that the soldier is actually married to someone else. Beautifully photographed with a great musical score, this oddball romance should appeal to most females and sensitive males. Reeves and his costar, whose name I can't spell, are wonderful together. Giannini makes a great dastardly dad, and Quinn does his Zorba routine as the loving grandpa and family patriarch. The whole thing plays out like a fairy tale, sort of like "Pretty Woman." Which is to say, you won't believe it for one minute but you go along with it. And be prepared: The ending of this leisurely paced film is rather abrupt. An American director would have done a bit more, and staged a lavish wedding.

He has had a lot of time to think about who he is and what he wants to be. He and Debra Messing portray an often ignored segment of the American post war population, the ones who got married on the spur of the moment and were separated for four years during the war. They grew apart, and hardly know one another. So when Paul meets Victoria, he is pursuing a path unknown, a path beyond the dreams he made in his mind while separated from Betty. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon portrays the woman "in trouble", which at that time being pregnant out of wedlock was nearly cause for public stoning, and especially in a strict Roman Catholic family. Her performance, along with the stellar performances of Anthony Quinn as Victoria's grandfather and Giancarlo Giannini as Victoria's father, make this romance a stunning piece of true romance. Every scene, every nuance of the film presses you deeper and deeper into the feelings of the characters, and the scenery and photography are incredibly breathtaking. Rated PG-13 for sexual themes and war scenes, this is a film for Date Night with your significant other. Collectible, absolutely, if for no other reason than to have evidence of Keanu's occasional good sense in accepting a role.

It is their daughter Victoria that is the draw for Sutton. The story is rather special, though not entirely unpredictable, and is a rather nice backdrop to give Reeves the opportunity to play the engaging, gentlemanly, perfect but troubled veteran in this gentle drama. The scenery of the Aragon vineyard is beautiful, although I believe a lot of it is CGI, and the Aragon family are varied and demonstrate the rich tapestry of family life from the overbearing father Giancarlo Gianinni, the wise and strong mother Angelica Aragon and the irrepressible patriarch Anthony Quinn, who provides some lovely touching and funny moments. It is good to note at this point that - in light of one of those funny moments Reeves CAN sing, and the out of tune serenading of Victoria is acting! This film is what it is, a romance film, a stunningly beautiful production, well directed and with a good script. There are some moments of real tenderness and joy, and it says something about young men's experience of war and how they are left to cope with it alone. Genius it isn't, or groundbreaking, but it's really nice pretty picture indicative of the big studio star vehicle films of the time it is depicting.

    Reeves plays a GI back from the war who crosses paths with a young Hispanic woman on her way home, having been impregnated by one of her professors. She is convinced her old-world father will kill her, so the soldier offers to pose as her husband for one day. Of course, they quickly fall for each other, but this is complicated by the tyrannical father's hatred of this gringo, and the fact that the soldier is actually married to someone else. Beautifully photographed with a great musical score, this oddball romance should appeal to most females and sensitive males. Reeves and his costar, whose name I can't spell, are wonderful together. Giannini makes a great dastardly dad, and Quinn does his Zorba routine as the loving grandpa and family patriarch. The whole thing plays out like a fairy tale, sort of like "Pretty Woman." Which is to say, you won't believe it for one minute but you go along with it. And be prepared: The ending of this leisurely paced film is rather abrupt. An American director would have done a bit more, and staged a lavish wedding.

    There are a few scenes in this love story which will bring out a few chuckles, but all in all this is a film about family, love, and joy. Keanu Reeves portrays the orphan Paul Sutton, a man who has fought to be acknowledged all his life and has returned a decorated war hero and a young man in search of himself. He has had a lot of time to think about who he is and what he wants to be. He and Debra Messing portray an often ignored segment of the American post war population, the ones who got married on the spur of the moment and were separated for four years during the war. They grew apart, and hardly know one another. So when Paul meets Victoria, he is pursuing a path unknown, a path beyond the dreams he made in his mind while separated from Betty. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon portrays the woman "in trouble", which at that time being pregnant out of wedlock was nearly cause for public stoning, and especially in a strict Roman Catholic family. Her performance, along with the stellar performances of Anthony Quinn as Victoria's grandfather and Giancarlo Giannini as Victoria's father, make this romance a stunning piece of true romance. Every scene, every nuance of the film presses you deeper and deeper into the feelings of the characters, and the scenery and photography are incredibly breathtaking. Rated PG-13 for sexual themes and war scenes, this is a film for Date Night with your significant other. Collectible, absolutely, if for no other reason than to have evidence of Keanu's occasional good sense in accepting a role.

    I saw this film when it first opened many years ago, and liked it a lot. It's a film that can be enjoyed both on the big and small screen; the former to revel in the gorgeous cinematography while the latter because of its intimate story. The lush music score adds to the glorious work overall. Where were all the Oscar nominations?!? Anyway, i watched it again the other day on TV and that rekindled my passion for this movie. People like to unjustly dumb-down Keanu Reeves; all i want to say is Keanu has not allowed himself to be typecast. He has done comedy (Bill & Ted, Parenthood, Something's Gotta Give); romance (Walk in the Clouds, Sweet November, The Lake House); drama (River's Edge, Devil's Advocate); action (Speed, Matrix, Chain Reaction), and Shakespeare (Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing). I really can't think of a more canny actor.

    while the age of the technology has drastically changed from the time this film was first released, the principles and values remained unchallenged and firm. Love conquers all. Understandtably, the values of a family as shown by the ARAGON's is a true reflection of a God-loving people. . . more so, the second generation father had made it clear to provide the needed security of the future for his family, his children and the next generation to come but failed to show them when at the most needed time when his daughter returned from city pregnant without a true father. At the end of the day, realization takes place and made it best for all to be at peace with himself and the people they dearly loved. I would always recommend this film as its message could cross boundaries, time-lines and generations.

    A Walk In The Clouds is a lovely and unabashedly romantic film with gorgeous cinematography and a strong cast. Keanu Reeves is authentic as the orphan soldier who tries to help the beautiful daughter of a well-established Spanish family that owns a vineyard and winery in Northern California. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon plays Victoria with heart and sensitivity, and she and Keanu seem like a couple from the moment they meet. Anthony Quinn, who plays her grandfather steals every scene he's in with his charming performance. Keanu and Anthony have great chemistry together, and look like they could be related since they are similar in their height and build, their noses and even their face shapes! Although it came out in 1995, it holds up visually, since it takes place after WWII. The production values, sets, costumes, and hairstyles are appropriate for the time period. I heartily recommend this for all die-hard romantics! And lastly - Roger Ebert liked it, 'nuff said!

    When you put Anthony Quinn and Giancarlo Giannini together, you expect some magic. These are two GIANTS of the screen from Europe who have put together some of the most memorable performances on film. I think they could read the dictionary and make it sound important. Poor Keanu Reeves. His scenes with these two cinematic giants just showed how really out of his depth he was. He seems like an earnest guy, and he has found some roles that suit him, (The Matrix series.) but this was WAY over his head. If they had found someone else for the role, I think they could have pulled it off. That and..... The end? REALLY?! The story was quite a stretch from the start, but I felt like they kept it moving along, and there were some well written scenes. But when they set everything on fire at the end, it was just dumb and ridiculous. I will say this is one of the prettiest movies you will ever see. It's a bit spoiled by too much CGI and enhanced trickery. My guess is they got tired of waiting for nature to come up with some beautiful sunsets for them. But the rest of the cinematography is really good. For romantics only. (And REALLY big Keanu fans!)

    In terms of what "A Walk in the Clouds" does right and wrong, it's like "Memoirs of a Geisha," a dissimilar romance that came out a decade later. The acting is great. The cinematography is breathtaking. The film works with pure magic. But there's a big problem: the screenplay is terrible. Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) is a war hero returning from the Pacific to be reunited with a girl he married "just so I could have someone to write to" (Debra Messing). Realizing that he's entered into a nightmare, he resumes his job as a chocolate salesman. On a bus to Sacremento for his job, he meets Victoria Aragon (Aitana Sanchez-Guijon), a Mexican beauty who is pregnant and unmarried. This would be troubling for anyone, but Victoria's father, Alberto (Giancarlo Giannini) is so traditional he makes Jerry Falwell look positively liberal. Because Paul is such a nice guy, he agrees to pose as her husband for a day, then leave her, which would hopefully solve the problem. Of course, they fall in love, which makes the situation even more complicated. The acting is solid. Many people give Keanu Reeves a hard time about his performances, and that's a little unfair. True, he's no Sean Penn, and I doubt that anyone will mention his name and "Oscar" in the same sentence any time soon, but given the right role, he can be effective. This was true of "Speed," "The Matrix," and "The Devil's Advocate," which I consider his best performance. "A Walk in the Clouds" should be among that list. It's easily the weakest of the three, but his performance is not. Paul is so immensely likable that it would turn the movie into a case of sugar shock, except that Reeves keeps Paul so genuine that it is impossible to not like him. His co-star, Aitana Sanchez-Guijon, is solid, although their chemistry is more of the "great friends" variety, not "star-crossed lovers." The other main actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Anthony Quinn, are excellent. Giannini is Oscar-worthy as Alberto. He's rigidly traditional, but it's his love of his family that makes him so. Ironically, however, it makes him blind to the needs of others. His father, Don Pedro (Quinn), is like the rest of his family: wise and more open. He always on hand to give advice on love and marriage to the would-be husband. He is also present in a hilarious scene where he gets Paul (and himself) very drunk and has him sing a traditional Mexican courting song outside Victoria's window. Alfonso Arau made the art-house hit, "Like Water for Chocolate," a film that I haven't seen, but is in my Netflix queue (and has been for some time). The middle part is magic, and it's Arau's talent that speaks to that. Unfortunately, the beginning is clunky, and the ending is completely over-the-top. Not all of this can be blamed on Arau, however. It's his first mainstream American film, so he was probably forced to make some concessions at the behest of the producers. However, even they should have realized that some of the lines needed to be rewritten. Overall, it works, but not as well as you'd hope.

    Believe it or not, I was even laughing at some of the scenes in this film which has the most beautiful musical score imaginable. The scene with the family trampling on the grapes vividly reminded me of Lucille Ball doing the same thing on her famous television show. The scene where Keanu Reeves comes home from World War 11 to an unfaithful wife brought me back to Dana Andrews and Virginia Mayo in "The Best Years of Our Lives." Giancarlo Giannini is the distrusting drunkard of a father here. His daughter, unmarried and pregnant, returns home and on the road finds Keanu Reeves, a chocolate salesman and recent war hero. Reeves agrees to pretend that he is wed to the young lady. Giannini immediately takes a dislike to Reeves as he doesn't trust him and his cynical regarding his daughter's relationship. In a drunken fit, he accidentally sets the wine valley ablaze. Of course, Reeves pulls out a root which shows no damage. His pulling it out reminded me of Vivien Leigh clutching the soil in "Gone With the Wind." Again, I laughed. Anthony Quinn played the elderly grandfather who is philosophical and wise. Had he been 20 years younger, he would have had the Giannini part.

    This is basically a film with no weaknesses. A couple of important points: First, I have seen a few reviews of the film complaining about the fire scene. Spoilers ahead: That scene is brilliant and necessary because Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) showed Alberto Aragon (Giancarlo Giannini), that he has what it takes to follow in his footsteps to not only run the winery, but to make it even better (Which is what the last scene in the film shows). The fire essentially was a cleansing agent, erasing the old and bringing in the new. Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn (Who did the best acting job in the film)), knew that Paul had what it takes to run things which is why he said to Paul "I have faith in you and my son." This point is critical because he knew Pedro Jr (Freddy Rodriguez), had no interest in running the business, thus, only Paul had what it took to keep the business going after Alberto passed on. At the end, Alberto realizes what kind of man Paul is, and says to Paul: "This is your family, and this is your roots." Paul honestly does not know what to do, but Alberto tells Victoria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (Who is a knockout to say the least)), to "Go to your husband." I have also seen critics complain about Paul leaving his wife Betty (Debra Sutton), for Victoria. If I came back from the War, and saw my wife in bed with another man, I would not want anything to do with her either. One more point about Paul he was perfect for Victoria, because of the way he carried himself: He was tortured by what happened to him in the war, then walks in his home to see what Betty did (And walks away, instead of hitting him, her, or both), yet was willing to help a total stranger (Victoria) who is terrified of her father, when they met on a bus. He finally learned to not only love Victoria, but the entire Aragon way of life, and essentially embraced being an Aragon. Which is a life far better than the world he came from (Including being raised in an orphanage). It is interesting that it is something Pedro Jr and to a lesser extent, Victoria did not want. Next the scenery is incredible. Particularly the scene with the women crushing the grapes with their feet. There are so many themes in this film it is not funny: Love, honor, responsibility, decency, acceptance, change & renewal to name a few. Do I love this movie? You better believe it (Not to mention who would not want Victoria? (But that is another issue)). Flawless film and an easy 10/10 stars.

    Paul Sutton (Reeves) comes back from the war (WWII) to find his new bride is not waiting for him. Going back to work as a travelling chocolate salesman, he gets tied up with the Aragon family; a historic Mexican family who have a large and beautiful vineyard. It is their daughter Victoria that is the draw for Sutton. The story is rather special, though not entirely unpredictable, and is a rather nice backdrop to give Reeves the opportunity to play the engaging, gentlemanly, perfect but troubled veteran in this gentle drama. The scenery of the Aragon vineyard is beautiful, although I believe a lot of it is CGI, and the Aragon family are varied and demonstrate the rich tapestry of family life from the overbearing father Giancarlo Gianinni, the wise and strong mother Angelica Aragon and the irrepressible patriarch Anthony Quinn, who provides some lovely touching and funny moments. It is good to note at this point that - in light of one of those funny moments Reeves CAN sing, and the out of tune serenading of Victoria is acting! This film is what it is, a romance film, a stunningly beautiful production, well directed and with a good script. There are some moments of real tenderness and joy, and it says something about young men's experience of war and how they are left to cope with it alone. Genius it isn't, or groundbreaking, but it's really nice pretty picture indicative of the big studio star vehicle films of the time it is depicting.

    This is basically a film with no weaknesses. A couple of important points: First, I have seen a few reviews of the film complaining about the fire scene. Spoilers ahead: That scene is brilliant and necessary because Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) showed Alberto Aragon (Giancarlo Giannini), that he has what it takes to follow in his footsteps to not only run the winery, but to make it even better (Which is what the last scene in the film shows). The fire essentially was a cleansing agent, erasing the old and bringing in the new. Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn (Who did the best acting job in the film)), knew that Paul had what it takes to run things which is why he said to Paul "I have faith in you and my son." This point is critical because he knew Pedro Jr (Freddy Rodriguez), had no interest in running the business, thus, only Paul had what it took to keep the business going after Alberto passed on. At the end, Alberto realizes what kind of man Paul is, and says to Paul: "This is your family, and this is your roots." Paul honestly does not know what to do, but Alberto tells Victoria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (Who is a knockout to say the least)), to "Go to your husband." I have also seen critics complain about Paul leaving his wife Betty (Debra Sutton), for Victoria. If I came back from the War, and saw my wife in bed with another man, I would not want anything to do with her either. One more point about Paul he was perfect for Victoria, because of the way he carried himself: He was tortured by what happened to him in the war, then walks in his home to see what Betty did (And walks away, instead of hitting him, her, or both), yet was willing to help a total stranger (Victoria) who is terrified of her father, when they met on a bus. He finally learned to not only love Victoria, but the entire Aragon way of life, and essentially embraced being an Aragon. Which is a life far better than the world he came from (Including being raised in an orphanage). It is interesting that it is something Pedro Jr and to a lesser extent, Victoria did not want. Next the scenery is incredible. Particularly the scene with the women crushing the grapes with their feet. There are so many themes in this film it is not funny: Love, honor, responsibility, decency, acceptance, change & renewal to name a few. Do I love this movie? You better believe it (Not to mention who would not want Victoria? (But that is another issue)). Flawless film and an easy 10/10 stars.

    Paul Sutton (Reeves) comes back from the war (WWII) to find his new bride is not waiting for him. Going back to work as a travelling chocolate salesman, he gets tied up with the Aragon family; a historic Mexican family who have a large and beautiful vineyard. It is their daughter Victoria that is the draw for Sutton. The story is rather special, though not entirely unpredictable, and is a rather nice backdrop to give Reeves the opportunity to play the engaging, gentlemanly, perfect but troubled veteran in this gentle drama. The scenery of the Aragon vineyard is beautiful, although I believe a lot of it is CGI, and the Aragon family are varied and demonstrate the rich tapestry of family life from the overbearing father Giancarlo Gianinni, the wise and strong mother Angelica Aragon and the irrepressible patriarch Anthony Quinn, who provides some lovely touching and funny moments. It is good to note at this point that - in light of one of those funny moments Reeves CAN sing, and the out of tune serenading of Victoria is acting! This film is what it is, a romance film, a stunningly beautiful production, well directed and with a good script. There are some moments of real tenderness and joy, and it says something about young men's experience of war and how they are left to cope with it alone. Genius it isn't, or groundbreaking, but it's really nice pretty picture indicative of the big studio star vehicle films of the time it is depicting.

    Reeves plays a GI back from the war who crosses paths with a young Hispanic woman on her way home, having been impregnated by one of her professors. She is convinced her old-world father will kill her, so the soldier offers to pose as her husband for one day. Of course, they quickly fall for each other, but this is complicated by the tyrannical father's hatred of this gringo, and the fact that the soldier is actually married to someone else. Beautifully photographed with a great musical score, this oddball romance should appeal to most females and sensitive males. Reeves and his costar, whose name I can't spell, are wonderful together. Giannini makes a great dastardly dad, and Quinn does his Zorba routine as the loving grandpa and family patriarch. The whole thing plays out like a fairy tale, sort of like "Pretty Woman." Which is to say, you won't believe it for one minute but you go along with it. And be prepared: The ending of this leisurely paced film is rather abrupt. An American director would have done a bit more, and staged a lavish wedding.

    There are a few scenes in this love story which will bring out a few chuckles, but all in all this is a film about family, love, and joy. Keanu Reeves portrays the orphan Paul Sutton, a man who has fought to be acknowledged all his life and has returned a decorated war hero and a young man in search of himself. He has had a lot of time to think about who he is and what he wants to be. He and Debra Messing portray an often ignored segment of the American post war population, the ones who got married on the spur of the moment and were separated for four years during the war. They grew apart, and hardly know one another. So when Paul meets Victoria, he is pursuing a path unknown, a path beyond the dreams he made in his mind while separated from Betty. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon portrays the woman "in trouble", which at that time being pregnant out of wedlock was nearly cause for public stoning, and especially in a strict Roman Catholic family. Her performance, along with the stellar performances of Anthony Quinn as Victoria's grandfather and Giancarlo Giannini as Victoria's father, make this romance a stunning piece of true romance. Every scene, every nuance of the film presses you deeper and deeper into the feelings of the characters, and the scenery and photography are incredibly breathtaking. Rated PG-13 for sexual themes and war scenes, this is a film for Date Night with your significant other. Collectible, absolutely, if for no other reason than to have evidence of Keanu's occasional good sense in accepting a role.

    I saw this film when it first opened many years ago, and liked it a lot. It's a film that can be enjoyed both on the big and small screen; the former to revel in the gorgeous cinematography while the latter because of its intimate story. The lush music score adds to the glorious work overall. Where were all the Oscar nominations?!? Anyway, i watched it again the other day on TV and that rekindled my passion for this movie. People like to unjustly dumb-down Keanu Reeves; all i want to say is Keanu has not allowed himself to be typecast. He has done comedy (Bill & Ted, Parenthood, Something's Gotta Give); romance (Walk in the Clouds, Sweet November, The Lake House); drama (River's Edge, Devil's Advocate); action (Speed, Matrix, Chain Reaction), and Shakespeare (Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing). I really can't think of a more canny actor.

    while the age of the technology has drastically changed from the time this film was first released, the principles and values remained unchallenged and firm. Love conquers all. Understandtably, the values of a family as shown by the ARAGON's is a true reflection of a God-loving people. . . more so, the second generation father had made it clear to provide the needed security of the future for his family, his children and the next generation to come but failed to show them when at the most needed time when his daughter returned from city pregnant without a true father. At the end of the day, realization takes place and made it best for all to be at peace with himself and the people they dearly loved. I would always recommend this film as its message could cross boundaries, time-lines and generations.

    A Walk In The Clouds is a lovely and unabashedly romantic film with gorgeous cinematography and a strong cast. Keanu Reeves is authentic as the orphan soldier who tries to help the beautiful daughter of a well-established Spanish family that owns a vineyard and winery in Northern California. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon plays Victoria with heart and sensitivity, and she and Keanu seem like a couple from the moment they meet. Anthony Quinn, who plays her grandfather steals every scene he's in with his charming performance. Keanu and Anthony have great chemistry together, and look like they could be related since they are similar in their height and build, their noses and even their face shapes! Although it came out in 1995, it holds up visually, since it takes place after WWII. The production values, sets, costumes, and hairstyles are appropriate for the time period. I heartily recommend this for all die-hard romantics! And lastly - Roger Ebert liked it, 'nuff said!

    When you put Anthony Quinn and Giancarlo Giannini together, you expect some magic. These are two GIANTS of the screen from Europe who have put together some of the most memorable performances on film. I think they could read the dictionary and make it sound important. Poor Keanu Reeves. His scenes with these two cinematic giants just showed how really out of his depth he was. He seems like an earnest guy, and he has found some roles that suit him, (The Matrix series.) but this was WAY over his head. If they had found someone else for the role, I think they could have pulled it off. That and..... The end? REALLY?! The story was quite a stretch from the start, but I felt like they kept it moving along, and there were some well written scenes. But when they set everything on fire at the end, it was just dumb and ridiculous. I will say this is one of the prettiest movies you will ever see. It's a bit spoiled by too much CGI and enhanced trickery. My guess is they got tired of waiting for nature to come up with some beautiful sunsets for them. But the rest of the cinematography is really good. For romantics only. (And REALLY big Keanu fans!)

    In terms of what "A Walk in the Clouds" does right and wrong, it's like "Memoirs of a Geisha," a dissimilar romance that came out a decade later. The acting is great. The cinematography is breathtaking. The film works with pure magic. But there's a big problem: the screenplay is terrible. Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) is a war hero returning from the Pacific to be reunited with a girl he married "just so I could have someone to write to" (Debra Messing). Realizing that he's entered into a nightmare, he resumes his job as a chocolate salesman. On a bus to Sacremento for his job, he meets Victoria Aragon (Aitana Sanchez-Guijon), a Mexican beauty who is pregnant and unmarried. This would be troubling for anyone, but Victoria's father, Alberto (Giancarlo Giannini) is so traditional he makes Jerry Falwell look positively liberal. Because Paul is such a nice guy, he agrees to pose as her husband for a day, then leave her, which would hopefully solve the problem. Of course, they fall in love, which makes the situation even more complicated. The acting is solid. Many people give Keanu Reeves a hard time about his performances, and that's a little unfair. True, he's no Sean Penn, and I doubt that anyone will mention his name and "Oscar" in the same sentence any time soon, but given the right role, he can be effective. This was true of "Speed," "The Matrix," and "The Devil's Advocate," which I consider his best performance. "A Walk in the Clouds" should be among that list. It's easily the weakest of the three, but his performance is not. Paul is so immensely likable that it would turn the movie into a case of sugar shock, except that Reeves keeps Paul so genuine that it is impossible to not like him. His co-star, Aitana Sanchez-Guijon, is solid, although their chemistry is more of the "great friends" variety, not "star-crossed lovers." The other main actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Anthony Quinn, are excellent. Giannini is Oscar-worthy as Alberto. He's rigidly traditional, but it's his love of his family that makes him so. Ironically, however, it makes him blind to the needs of others. His father, Don Pedro (Quinn), is like the rest of his family: wise and more open. He always on hand to give advice on love and marriage to the would-be husband. He is also present in a hilarious scene where he gets Paul (and himself) very drunk and has him sing a traditional Mexican courting song outside Victoria's window. Alfonso Arau made the art-house hit, "Like Water for Chocolate," a film that I haven't seen, but is in my Netflix queue (and has been for some time). The middle part is magic, and it's Arau's talent that speaks to that. Unfortunately, the beginning is clunky, and the ending is completely over-the-top. Not all of this can be blamed on Arau, however. It's his first mainstream American film, so he was probably forced to make some concessions at the behest of the producers. However, even they should have realized that some of the lines needed to be rewritten. Overall, it works, but not as well as you'd hope.

    Believe it or not, I was even laughing at some of the scenes in this film which has the most beautiful musical score imaginable. The scene with the family trampling on the grapes vividly reminded me of Lucille Ball doing the same thing on her famous television show. The scene where Keanu Reeves comes home from World War 11 to an unfaithful wife brought me back to Dana Andrews and Virginia Mayo in "The Best Years of Our Lives." Giancarlo Giannini is the distrusting drunkard of a father here. His daughter, unmarried and pregnant, returns home and on the road finds Keanu Reeves, a chocolate salesman and recent war hero. Reeves agrees to pretend that he is wed to the young lady. Giannini immediately takes a dislike to Reeves as he doesn't trust him and his cynical regarding his daughter's relationship. In a drunken fit, he accidentally sets the wine valley ablaze. Of course, Reeves pulls out a root which shows no damage. His pulling it out reminded me of Vivien Leigh clutching the soil in "Gone With the Wind." Again, I laughed. Anthony Quinn played the elderly grandfather who is philosophical and wise. Had he been 20 years younger, he would have had the Giannini part.
