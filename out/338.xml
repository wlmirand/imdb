  Mister Bean: O Filme

 <rating>
  6.1
 </rating>
 <sinopse>
  The bumbling Mr. Bean travels to America when he is given the responsibility of bringing a highly valuable painting to a Los Angeles museum.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Bean works as a caretaker at Britain's formidable Royal National Gallery, and his bosses want to fire him because he sleeps at work all the time, but can't because the chairman of the gallery's board defends him. They send him to USA, to the small Los Angeles art gallery instead, where he'll have to officiate at the opening of the greatest US picture ever (called "Whistler's Mother").

    Mr Bean, Rowan Atkinson's most iconic role. There was clearly going to be a movie because the child-like antics of the character clearly was popular enough. In my eyes it doesn't translate well to the screen but this is certainly worth a watch. The plot of this movie is that Mr Bean (of ALL people!) is asked to present a speech on Whistler's portrait of his mother in America. The person who is curating also has the idea to have him stay with his family. So the plot is extremely thin. If you've seen the show you might know what to expect. I enjoyed Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean and everyone does their absolute best but there are a few complaints. Firstly. Mr Bean is a character that relies on pure physical comedy and not really that much else. His child-like antics are okay to watch for 30 minutes but this is nearly 90 minutes. It does get tiring after a while. Aside from that this is not that bad. It isn't anything special but it isn't unwatchable either. If you like the TV show then this is certainly worth a try.

    Bean is a really great comedy to watch. The premise is really great, and tell me if your going to like this; Mr.Bean works at the Royal gallery of London, and his bosses want to fire him, but is denied by the chairman, desperate to get rid off him they send him to America to review whistler's mother, that the Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Now what I love about the movie is the humor, they keep the nostalgia of Mr.Bean, they still have the turkey gag, that is great, they even have the blowing up an airsickness bag gag to, and bits with Mr.Bean are funny, like the bit where he mistakenly flips people off the people in LA. The flaw with this film is the family, they pretty much find him weird when they first meet him, and also judge him before they even meet him and saying that British people are wried. But its still is Mr. Bean, if you know and like Mr. Bean, you'll love this film.

    "Bean" was a huge part of my childhood. I'd watch it almost as much as "Mrs. Doubtfire" so I'm going to be extremely bias in my opinions. Sorry. We all know that Mr.Bean is a love it or hate it character (how could anyone hate?) I for one, LOVE Mr.Bean and find his farcical, childish and downright simple behaviour absolutely hilarious. We all know that doing a film based on a TV series isn't always such a great idea too, but here "Bean" absolutely pulls it off. The only thing wrong with the film is that is simply isn't long enough. Watching all the fantastic deleted scenes devastates me that they didn't include them in. "Bean" is one hilarious sequence after another, with actually a surprisingly great plot and some nice character development on the Langley family. Frankly is you the handkerchief scene doesn't make you laugh (eat you heart out Othello!) or even the drying the wet patch scene and the scene after that, then you know that Mr.Bean is not for you. The idea of Mr.Bean destroying America's greatest painting is a stroke of genius and it really is a hilarious sight to behold, as well as conveying a feeling of absolute disastrous terror! "Bean" also has a really fantastic sweeping score that I think deserves to have been Oscar-nominated! Rowan Atkinson also puts on another faultless performance as the character, and whilst the film isn't exactly perfect, it's still an absolutely hilarious and entertaining farce that flies by. So please don't get all superficial about "Bean" because it does exactly what it sets out to do.

    I saw this and could not stop laughing. I liked it because they took things from the TV show and put it in the movie. Spoilers. The way he messed up the painting was one of the funniest thing I had ever seen. The random underwear in the oven scene was so funny. The tissue up his nose is funny. There are so many more things that are in this movie that make me laugh all the time. When ever you see Mr. Bean in a situation where is alone that a major indication something very funny is about to happen. When he is mistaken to be a genius when he knows very little about paintings is always funny. The shower scene is great. This movie is packed with humor that is just as hilarious as it was the first time when watching it multiple times. The painting scene will defiantly cause a serious amount of laughter. This is my favorite comedy. This is very good.

    I couldn't believe when I saw the review that this movie was rated at a mere 5.9!!!!!.....I am a BIG fan of the Mr. Bean TV series and if you have seen it, you will know that Rowan Atkinson pulls off a splendid performance in each and every episode. As it is said for Tom and Jerry, it can be rightly said for Mr. Bean that action speaks louder than words.....Each and every Bean episode is filled with hilarity and Atkinson manages to do all that just be speaking a handful of words which is not the case with many modern day comedy shows where a lot of dialogs are needed. My suggestion is that if you are looking for a really nice movie with a lot of laughs and no complicated dialogs, RENT THIS ONE!!!!....It will be much more fun if you see if with someone who likes to laugh!!..... Mr. Bean ROCKS!!!.....

    When comedy was ruled by Jim Carrey back in the 90s, this movie was quite a welcome change. Although she does not deliver as much as we expect for a Bean movie! When Rowan Atkinson and Peter Macnicol (Ally Mcbeal, 24) team up together laughter does happen. Atkinson in particular is excellent; however I feel if he spoke more rather than stick to his silent movie approach the movie would have been more successful than it is. Expectations were quite high back in 1997 when this initially took over the cinemas and what feedback it got back in the day I am not very familiar with. No introduction is needed on this one. Since the British TV show Mr. Bean was aired in 1990, Bean has been a household name and the chances are a majority of the entire world has seen at least one episode of him. This wondrous story of a Man child is a creation of Rowan Atkinson himself. So what can you expect you pack it all up into one movie? Mel Smith, who took up the screen play that was done by Rowan Atkinson, is given a fairly arduous task I must say. This script is not the sharpest script written by Atkinson based on Mr. Bean. His intended humor was obviously that of the acting of Bean. However for those who are hardcore fans of the entire Mr. Bean franchise would have preferred a more original adaptation of the character. Something that will be done in the future with Johnny English Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) a caretaker at the British Royal National Gallery dodges a bullet when it is decided by the directors to send him to Los Angeles instead of firing him. The drawing of Whistlers Mother is apparently returning back to where she belongs - The United States. When David Langley (Peter Macnicol) decided to select a British art scholar instead of Bon Jovi to speak at the grand unveiling of the drawing, little did he know that Dr.Bean (he isn't a doctor really- I am sure you will figure that on your own) was what he has signed up for? The mayhem begins in flight when Bean pops a bag of vomit on a first class customer during cruise. Only Bean can make such a mistake. Whilst Bean is in flight, Langley is trying to convince his son and daughter about the scholar staying over at their place during his visit to LA. Alison Langley (Pamela Reed) who is not too thrilled about the whole idea gives her husband the benefit of the doubt. Soon they are about to find out how wrong they all were. Now it all is clear to me and now I am beginning to understand what viewers felt back in 1997. Disappointment! Hardly hitting Average! Title: Bean Directed by: Mel Smith Starring: Rowan Atkinson & Peter Macnicol Rated: PG13 for risqu&eacute; humor Rating: 05/10

    The TV series is a classic of a comedy series, so naturally this film had a lot to live up to. It comes close, but overall it isn't a patch on the TV series. Starting with the few I had, the plot is rather generic and somewhat predictable in areas too, and I think while making an effort to stick to the spirit of the series is rather thin for the running time. Also some of the melodrama is rather sappy for my tastes. On the other hand, the film does look great, so is the soundtrack, the physical comedy is laugh-out-loud-funny, Peter MacNicol is good in his conventional role and Rowan Atkinson is brilliant as Mr Bean. All in all, there is much to enjoy but it does fall short of the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    My late aunt and I both loved the "Mr. Bean" TV show, though my mother hated it, so my aunt and I eagerly went to the movie theater to see it. This was a box office hit? All it did was recycle some jokes from the TV show, add a stupid plot and a stupid supporting cast, and leave out the charm and cleverness. The idea of the TV show was that Mr. Bean used ingenious ways to deal with various situations, with varying degrees of success. Here he just acts like an idiot, and serves as the villain rather than the hero of the story. The one amusing bit in the movie (for which I gave an extra star) was where he distracted the security guard, then used laxatives to keep him away from his post for a sufficient time. But even then, it's the guard and not Mr. Bean who gets the laughs. We were both quite disappointed, and nobody else in the theater except for a little boy sitting next to me seemed to have any fun.

    First of all I was shocked to see how badly the movie was rated.Man it was rated 5.8 how could it be.This is one of the finest masterpiece of comedy from Mr. Rowan Atkinson.Hats off to you! My review 8/10 go for this one!!!!! His comedy does not look artificial he is so natural & comfortable while portraying his character.The story line was okay but only & only Mr.Atkinson gave it a superb zeal by his performance. Other actors did their job ,okay.The best thing about the movie is that you will enjoy it as a comic cracker also you will be glued to the seat anxiously thinking what is going to be the next disaster by Mr. Bean If u didn't get my point it's my fault because I haven't made the synopsis of this movie clear . For that you will have to watch it. I can say that You will enjoy it thoroughly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    I grew up watching Mr. Bean when I was little on HBO and I LOVE(D) IT!! Still a die-hard fan today. I remember my dad rented this movie for me when I was 6 years old and I cracked up for hours!! This movie also has a great plot involving Mr. Bean going to L.A. to "baby-sit" Whistler's Mother, a well-known painting who has finally returned to America at last for 2 months after his bosses fire him for not doing his job at the Royal National Gallery. I would have to say, if you love Rowan Atkinson and Mr. Bean and have never seen this movie before, I'd say WATCH IT! An excellent movie for the whole family (and friends)!!! A film every Mr. Bean fan should see!!! 10/10: a hilarious movie.

In my eyes it doesn't translate well to the screen but this is certainly worth a watch. The plot of this movie is that Mr Bean (of ALL people!) is asked to present a speech on Whistler's portrait of his mother in America. The person who is curating also has the idea to have him stay with his family. So the plot is extremely thin. If you've seen the show you might know what to expect. I enjoyed Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean and everyone does their absolute best but there are a few complaints. Firstly. Mr Bean is a character that relies on pure physical comedy and not really that much else. His child-like antics are okay to watch for 30 minutes but this is nearly 90 minutes. It does get tiring after a while. Aside from that this is not that bad. It isn't anything special but it isn't unwatchable either. If you like the TV show then this is certainly worth a try.

    Bean is a really great comedy to watch. The premise is really great, and tell me if your going to like this; Mr.Bean works at the Royal gallery of London, and his bosses want to fire him, but is denied by the chairman, desperate to get rid off him they send him to America to review whistler's mother, that the Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Now what I love about the movie is the humor, they keep the nostalgia of Mr.Bean, they still have the turkey gag, that is great, they even have the blowing up an airsickness bag gag to, and bits with Mr.Bean are funny, like the bit where he mistakenly flips people off the people in LA. The flaw with this film is the family, they pretty much find him weird when they first meet him, and also judge him before they even meet him and saying that British people are wried. But its still is Mr. Bean, if you know and like Mr. Bean, you'll love this film.

    "Bean" was a huge part of my childhood. I'd watch it almost as much as "Mrs. Doubtfire" so I'm going to be extremely bias in my opinions. Sorry. We all know that Mr.Bean is a love it or hate it character (how could anyone hate?) I for one, LOVE Mr.Bean and find his farcical, childish and downright simple behaviour absolutely hilarious. We all know that doing a film based on a TV series isn't always such a great idea too, but here "Bean" absolutely pulls it off. The only thing wrong with the film is that is simply isn't long enough. Watching all the fantastic deleted scenes devastates me that they didn't include them in. "Bean" is one hilarious sequence after another, with actually a surprisingly great plot and some nice character development on the Langley family. Frankly is you the handkerchief scene doesn't make you laugh (eat you heart out Othello!) or even the drying the wet patch scene and the scene after that, then you know that Mr.Bean is not for you. The idea of Mr.Bean destroying America's greatest painting is a stroke of genius and it really is a hilarious sight to behold, as well as conveying a feeling of absolute disastrous terror! "Bean" also has a really fantastic sweeping score that I think deserves to have been Oscar-nominated! Rowan Atkinson also puts on another faultless performance as the character, and whilst the film isn't exactly perfect, it's still an absolutely hilarious and entertaining farce that flies by. So please don't get all superficial about "Bean" because it does exactly what it sets out to do.

    I saw this and could not stop laughing. I liked it because they took things from the TV show and put it in the movie. Spoilers. The way he messed up the painting was one of the funniest thing I had ever seen. The random underwear in the oven scene was so funny. The tissue up his nose is funny. There are so many more things that are in this movie that make me laugh all the time. When ever you see Mr. Bean in a situation where is alone that a major indication something very funny is about to happen. When he is mistaken to be a genius when he knows very little about paintings is always funny. The shower scene is great. This movie is packed with humor that is just as hilarious as it was the first time when watching it multiple times. The painting scene will defiantly cause a serious amount of laughter. This is my favorite comedy. This is very good.

    I couldn't believe when I saw the review that this movie was rated at a mere 5.9!!!!!.....I am a BIG fan of the Mr. Bean TV series and if you have seen it, you will know that Rowan Atkinson pulls off a splendid performance in each and every episode. As it is said for Tom and Jerry, it can be rightly said for Mr. Bean that action speaks louder than words.....Each and every Bean episode is filled with hilarity and Atkinson manages to do all that just be speaking a handful of words which is not the case with many modern day comedy shows where a lot of dialogs are needed. My suggestion is that if you are looking for a really nice movie with a lot of laughs and no complicated dialogs, RENT THIS ONE!!!!....It will be much more fun if you see if with someone who likes to laugh!!..... Mr. Bean ROCKS!!!.....

    When comedy was ruled by Jim Carrey back in the 90s, this movie was quite a welcome change. Although she does not deliver as much as we expect for a Bean movie! When Rowan Atkinson and Peter Macnicol (Ally Mcbeal, 24) team up together laughter does happen. Atkinson in particular is excellent; however I feel if he spoke more rather than stick to his silent movie approach the movie would have been more successful than it is. Expectations were quite high back in 1997 when this initially took over the cinemas and what feedback it got back in the day I am not very familiar with. No introduction is needed on this one. Since the British TV show Mr. Bean was aired in 1990, Bean has been a household name and the chances are a majority of the entire world has seen at least one episode of him. This wondrous story of a Man child is a creation of Rowan Atkinson himself. So what can you expect you pack it all up into one movie? Mel Smith, who took up the screen play that was done by Rowan Atkinson, is given a fairly arduous task I must say. This script is not the sharpest script written by Atkinson based on Mr. Bean. His intended humor was obviously that of the acting of Bean. However for those who are hardcore fans of the entire Mr. Bean franchise would have preferred a more original adaptation of the character. Something that will be done in the future with Johnny English Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) a caretaker at the British Royal National Gallery dodges a bullet when it is decided by the directors to send him to Los Angeles instead of firing him. The drawing of Whistlers Mother is apparently returning back to where she belongs - The United States. When David Langley (Peter Macnicol) decided to select a British art scholar instead of Bon Jovi to speak at the grand unveiling of the drawing, little did he know that Dr.Bean (he isn't a doctor really- I am sure you will figure that on your own) was what he has signed up for? The mayhem begins in flight when Bean pops a bag of vomit on a first class customer during cruise. Only Bean can make such a mistake. Whilst Bean is in flight, Langley is trying to convince his son and daughter about the scholar staying over at their place during his visit to LA. Alison Langley (Pamela Reed) who is not too thrilled about the whole idea gives her husband the benefit of the doubt. Soon they are about to find out how wrong they all were. Now it all is clear to me and now I am beginning to understand what viewers felt back in 1997. Disappointment! Hardly hitting Average!

    The TV series is a classic of a comedy series, so naturally this film had a lot to live up to. It comes close, but overall it isn't a patch on the TV series. Starting with the few I had, the plot is rather generic and somewhat predictable in areas too, and I think while making an effort to stick to the spirit of the series is rather thin for the running time. Also some of the melodrama is rather sappy for my tastes. On the other hand, the film does look great, so is the soundtrack, the physical comedy is laugh-out-loud-funny, Peter MacNicol is good in his conventional role and Rowan Atkinson is brilliant as Mr Bean. All in all, there is much to enjoy but it does fall short of the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    My late aunt and I both loved the "Mr. Bean" TV show, though my mother hated it, so my aunt and I eagerly went to the movie theater to see it. This was a box office hit? All it did was recycle some jokes from the TV show, add a stupid plot and a stupid supporting cast, and leave out the charm and cleverness. The idea of the TV show was that Mr. Bean used ingenious ways to deal with various situations, with varying degrees of success. Here he just acts like an idiot, and serves as the villain rather than the hero of the story. The one amusing bit in the movie (for which I gave an extra star) was where he distracted the security guard, then used laxatives to keep him away from his post for a sufficient time. But even then, it's the guard and not Mr. Bean who gets the laughs. We were both quite disappointed, and nobody else in the theater except for a little boy sitting next to me seemed to have any fun.

    First of all I was shocked to see how badly the movie was rated.Man it was rated 5.8 how could it be.This is one of the finest masterpiece of comedy from Mr. Rowan Atkinson.Hats off to you! My review 8/10 go for this one!!!!! His comedy does not look artificial he is so natural & comfortable while portraying his character.The story line was okay but only & only Mr.Atkinson gave it a superb zeal by his performance. Other actors did their job ,okay.The best thing about the movie is that you will enjoy it as a comic cracker also you will be glued to the seat anxiously thinking what is going to be the next disaster by Mr. Bean If u didn't get my point it's my fault because I haven't made the synopsis of this movie clear . For that you will have to watch it. I can say that You will enjoy it thoroughly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    I grew up watching Mr. Bean when I was little on HBO and I LOVE(D) IT!! Still a die-hard fan today. I remember my dad rented this movie for me when I was 6 years old and I cracked up for hours!! This movie also has a great plot involving Mr. Bean going to L.A. to "baby-sit" Whistler's Mother, a well-known painting who has finally returned to America at last for 2 months after his bosses fire him for not doing his job at the Royal National Gallery. I would have to say, if you love Rowan Atkinson and Mr. Bean and have never seen this movie before, I'd say WATCH IT! An excellent movie for the whole family (and friends)!!! A film every Mr. Bean fan should see!!! 10/10: a hilarious movie.

Watching all the fantastic deleted scenes devastates me that they didn't include them in. "Bean" is one hilarious sequence after another, with actually a surprisingly great plot and some nice character development on the Langley family. Frankly is you the handkerchief scene doesn't make you laugh (eat you heart out Othello!) or even the drying the wet patch scene and the scene after that, then you know that Mr.Bean is not for you. The idea of Mr.Bean destroying America's greatest painting is a stroke of genius and it really is a hilarious sight to behold, as well as conveying a feeling of absolute disastrous terror! "Bean" also has a really fantastic sweeping score that I think deserves to have been Oscar-nominated! Rowan Atkinson also puts on another faultless performance as the character, and whilst the film isn't exactly perfect, it's still an absolutely hilarious and entertaining farce that flies by. So please don't get all superficial about "Bean" because it does exactly what it sets out to do.

    I saw this and could not stop laughing. I liked it because they took things from the TV show and put it in the movie. Spoilers. The way he messed up the painting was one of the funniest thing I had ever seen. The random underwear in the oven scene was so funny. The tissue up his nose is funny. There are so many more things that are in this movie that make me laugh all the time. When ever you see Mr. Bean in a situation where is alone that a major indication something very funny is about to happen. When he is mistaken to be a genius when he knows very little about paintings is always funny. The shower scene is great. This movie is packed with humor that is just as hilarious as it was the first time when watching it multiple times. The painting scene will defiantly cause a serious amount of laughter. This is my favorite comedy. This is very good.

    I couldn't believe when I saw the review that this movie was rated at a mere 5.9!!!!!.....I am a BIG fan of the Mr. Bean TV series and if you have seen it, you will know that Rowan Atkinson pulls off a splendid performance in each and every episode. As it is said for Tom and Jerry, it can be rightly said for Mr. Bean that action speaks louder than words.....Each and every Bean episode is filled with hilarity and Atkinson manages to do all that just be speaking a handful of words which is not the case with many modern day comedy shows where a lot of dialogs are needed. My suggestion is that if you are looking for a really nice movie with a lot of laughs and no complicated dialogs, RENT THIS ONE!!!!....It will be much more fun if you see if with someone who likes to laugh!!..... Mr. Bean ROCKS!!!.....

    When comedy was ruled by Jim Carrey back in the 90s, this movie was quite a welcome change. Although she does not deliver as much as we expect for a Bean movie! When Rowan Atkinson and Peter Macnicol (Ally Mcbeal, 24) team up together laughter does happen. Atkinson in particular is excellent; however I feel if he spoke more rather than stick to his silent movie approach the movie would have been more successful than it is. Expectations were quite high back in 1997 when this initially took over the cinemas and what feedback it got back in the day I am not very familiar with. No introduction is needed on this one. Since the British TV show Mr. Bean was aired in 1990, Bean has been a household name and the chances are a majority of the entire world has seen at least one episode of him. This wondrous story of a Man child is a creation of Rowan Atkinson himself. So what can you expect you pack it all up into one movie? Mel Smith, who took up the screen play that was done by Rowan Atkinson, is given a fairly arduous task I must say. This script is not the sharpest script written by Atkinson based on Mr. Bean. His intended humor was obviously that of the acting of Bean. However for those who are hardcore fans of the entire Mr. Bean franchise would have preferred a more original adaptation of the character. Something that will be done in the future with Johnny English Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) a caretaker at the British Royal National Gallery dodges a bullet when it is decided by the directors to send him to Los Angeles instead of firing him. The drawing of Whistlers Mother is apparently returning back to where she belongs - The United States. When David Langley (Peter Macnicol) decided to select a British art scholar instead of Bon Jovi to speak at the grand unveiling of the drawing, little did he know that Dr.Bean (he isn't a doctor really- I am sure you will figure that on your own) was what he has signed up for? The mayhem begins in flight when Bean pops a bag of vomit on a first class customer during cruise. Only Bean can make such a mistake. Whilst Bean is in flight, Langley is trying to convince his son and daughter about the scholar staying over at their place during his visit to LA. Alison Langley (Pamela Reed) who is not too thrilled about the whole idea gives her husband the benefit of the doubt. Soon they are about to find out how wrong they all were. Now it all is clear to me and now I am beginning to understand what viewers felt back in 1997. Disappointment! Hardly hitting Average!

    The TV series is a classic of a comedy series, so naturally this film had a lot to live up to. It comes close, but overall it isn't a patch on the TV series. Starting with the few I had, the plot is rather generic and somewhat predictable in areas too, and I think while making an effort to stick to the spirit of the series is rather thin for the running time. Also some of the melodrama is rather sappy for my tastes. On the other hand, the film does look great, so is the soundtrack, the physical comedy is laugh-out-loud-funny, Peter MacNicol is good in his conventional role and Rowan Atkinson is brilliant as Mr Bean. All in all, there is much to enjoy but it does fall short of the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    My late aunt and I both loved the "Mr. Bean" TV show, though my mother hated it, so my aunt and I eagerly went to the movie theater to see it. This was a box office hit? All it did was recycle some jokes from the TV show, add a stupid plot and a stupid supporting cast, and leave out the charm and cleverness. The idea of the TV show was that Mr. Bean used ingenious ways to deal with various situations, with varying degrees of success. Here he just acts like an idiot, and serves as the villain rather than the hero of the story. The one amusing bit in the movie (for which I gave an extra star) was where he distracted the security guard, then used laxatives to keep him away from his post for a sufficient time. But even then, it's the guard and not Mr. Bean who gets the laughs. We were both quite disappointed, and nobody else in the theater except for a little boy sitting next to me seemed to have any fun.

    First of all I was shocked to see how badly the movie was rated.Man it was rated 5.8 how could it be.This is one of the finest masterpiece of comedy from Mr. Rowan Atkinson.Hats off to you! My review 8/10 go for this one!!!!! His comedy does not look artificial he is so natural & comfortable while portraying his character.The story line was okay but only & only Mr.Atkinson gave it a superb zeal by his performance. Other actors did their job ,okay.The best thing about the movie is that you will enjoy it as a comic cracker also you will be glued to the seat anxiously thinking what is going to be the next disaster by Mr. Bean If u didn't get my point it's my fault because I haven't made the synopsis of this movie clear . For that you will have to watch it. I can say that You will enjoy it thoroughly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    I grew up watching Mr. Bean when I was little on HBO and I LOVE(D) IT!! Still a die-hard fan today. I remember my dad rented this movie for me when I was 6 years old and I cracked up for hours!! This movie also has a great plot involving Mr. Bean going to L.A. to "baby-sit" Whistler's Mother, a well-known painting who has finally returned to America at last for 2 months after his bosses fire him for not doing his job at the Royal National Gallery. I would have to say, if you love Rowan Atkinson and Mr. Bean and have never seen this movie before, I'd say WATCH IT! An excellent movie for the whole family (and friends)!!! A film every Mr. Bean fan should see!!! 10/10: a hilarious movie.

    Mr Bean, Rowan Atkinson's most iconic role. There was clearly going to be a movie because the child-like antics of the character clearly was popular enough. In my eyes it doesn't translate well to the screen but this is certainly worth a watch. The plot of this movie is that Mr Bean (of ALL people!) is asked to present a speech on Whistler's portrait of his mother in America. The person who is curating also has the idea to have him stay with his family. So the plot is extremely thin. If you've seen the show you might know what to expect. I enjoyed Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean and everyone does their absolute best but there are a few complaints. Firstly. Mr Bean is a character that relies on pure physical comedy and not really that much else. His child-like antics are okay to watch for 30 minutes but this is nearly 90 minutes. It does get tiring after a while. Aside from that this is not that bad. It isn't anything special but it isn't unwatchable either. If you like the TV show then this is certainly worth a try.

    Bean is a really great comedy to watch. The premise is really great, and tell me if your going to like this; Mr.Bean works at the Royal gallery of London, and his bosses want to fire him, but is denied by the chairman, desperate to get rid off him they send him to America to review whistler's mother, that the Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Now what I love about the movie is the humor, they keep the nostalgia of Mr.Bean, they still have the turkey gag, that is great, they even have the blowing up an airsickness bag gag to, and bits with Mr.Bean are funny, like the bit where he mistakenly flips people off the people in LA. The flaw with this film is the family, they pretty much find him weird when they first meet him, and also judge him before they even meet him and saying that British people are wried. But its still is Mr. Bean, if you know and like Mr. Bean, you'll love this film.

    I couldn't believe when I saw the review that this movie was rated at a mere 5.9!!!!!.....I am a BIG fan of the Mr. Bean TV series and if you have seen it, you will know that Rowan Atkinson pulls off a splendid performance in each and every episode. As it is said for Tom and Jerry, it can be rightly said for Mr. Bean that action speaks louder than words.....Each and every Bean episode is filled with hilarity and Atkinson manages to do all that just be speaking a handful of words which is not the case with many modern day comedy shows where a lot of dialogs are needed. My suggestion is that if you are looking for a really nice movie with a lot of laughs and no complicated dialogs, RENT THIS ONE!!!!....It will be much more fun if you see if with someone who likes to laugh!!..... Mr. Bean ROCKS!!!.....

    When comedy was ruled by Jim Carrey back in the 90s, this movie was quite a welcome change. Although she does not deliver as much as we expect for a Bean movie! When Rowan Atkinson and Peter Macnicol (Ally Mcbeal, 24) team up together laughter does happen. Atkinson in particular is excellent; however I feel if he spoke more rather than stick to his silent movie approach the movie would have been more successful than it is. Expectations were quite high back in 1997 when this initially took over the cinemas and what feedback it got back in the day I am not very familiar with. No introduction is needed on this one. Since the British TV show Mr. Bean was aired in 1990, Bean has been a household name and the chances are a majority of the entire world has seen at least one episode of him. This wondrous story of a Man child is a creation of Rowan Atkinson himself. So what can you expect you pack it all up into one movie? Mel Smith, who took up the screen play that was done by Rowan Atkinson, is given a fairly arduous task I must say. This script is not the sharpest script written by Atkinson based on Mr. Bean. His intended humor was obviously that of the acting of Bean. However for those who are hardcore fans of the entire Mr. Bean franchise would have preferred a more original adaptation of the character. Something that will be done in the future with Johnny English Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) a caretaker at the British Royal National Gallery dodges a bullet when it is decided by the directors to send him to Los Angeles instead of firing him. The drawing of Whistlers Mother is apparently returning back to where she belongs - The United States. When David Langley (Peter Macnicol) decided to select a British art scholar instead of Bon Jovi to speak at the grand unveiling of the drawing, little did he know that Dr.Bean (he isn't a doctor really- I am sure you will figure that on your own) was what he has signed up for? The mayhem begins in flight when Bean pops a bag of vomit on a first class customer during cruise. Only Bean can make such a mistake. Whilst Bean is in flight, Langley is trying to convince his son and daughter about the scholar staying over at their place during his visit to LA. Alison Langley (Pamela Reed) who is not too thrilled about the whole idea gives her husband the benefit of the doubt. Soon they are about to find out how wrong they all were. Now it all is clear to me and now I am beginning to understand what viewers felt back in 1997. Disappointment! Hardly hitting Average! Title: Bean Directed by: Mel Smith Starring: Rowan Atkinson & Peter Macnicol Rated: PG13 for risqu&eacute; humor Rating: 05/10

    The TV series is a classic of a comedy series, so naturally this film had a lot to live up to. It comes close, but overall it isn't a patch on the TV series. Starting with the few I had, the plot is rather generic and somewhat predictable in areas too, and I think while making an effort to stick to the spirit of the series is rather thin for the running time. Also some of the melodrama is rather sappy for my tastes. On the other hand, the film does look great, so is the soundtrack, the physical comedy is laugh-out-loud-funny, Peter MacNicol is good in his conventional role and Rowan Atkinson is brilliant as Mr Bean. All in all, there is much to enjoy but it does fall short of the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    My late aunt and I both loved the "Mr. Bean" TV show, though my mother hated it, so my aunt and I eagerly went to the movie theater to see it. This was a box office hit? All it did was recycle some jokes from the TV show, add a stupid plot and a stupid supporting cast, and leave out the charm and cleverness. The idea of the TV show was that Mr. Bean used ingenious ways to deal with various situations, with varying degrees of success. Here he just acts like an idiot, and serves as the villain rather than the hero of the story. The one amusing bit in the movie (for which I gave an extra star) was where he distracted the security guard, then used laxatives to keep him away from his post for a sufficient time. But even then, it's the guard and not Mr. Bean who gets the laughs. We were both quite disappointed, and nobody else in the theater except for a little boy sitting next to me seemed to have any fun.

    First of all I was shocked to see how badly the movie was rated.Man it was rated 5.8 how could it be.This is one of the finest masterpiece of comedy from Mr. Rowan Atkinson.Hats off to you! My review 8/10 go for this one!!!!! His comedy does not look artificial he is so natural & comfortable while portraying his character.The story line was okay but only & only Mr.Atkinson gave it a superb zeal by his performance. Other actors did their job ,okay.The best thing about the movie is that you will enjoy it as a comic cracker also you will be glued to the seat anxiously thinking what is going to be the next disaster by Mr. Bean If u didn't get my point it's my fault because I haven't made the synopsis of this movie clear . For that you will have to watch it. I can say that You will enjoy it thoroughly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    I grew up watching Mr. Bean when I was little on HBO and I LOVE(D) IT!! Still a die-hard fan today. I remember my dad rented this movie for me when I was 6 years old and I cracked up for hours!! This movie also has a great plot involving Mr. Bean going to L.A. to "baby-sit" Whistler's Mother, a well-known painting who has finally returned to America at last for 2 months after his bosses fire him for not doing his job at the Royal National Gallery. I would have to say, if you love Rowan Atkinson and Mr. Bean and have never seen this movie before, I'd say WATCH IT! An excellent movie for the whole family (and friends)!!! A film every Mr. Bean fan should see!!! 10/10: a hilarious movie.

    Mr Bean, Rowan Atkinson's most iconic role. There was clearly going to be a movie because the child-like antics of the character clearly was popular enough. In my eyes it doesn't translate well to the screen but this is certainly worth a watch. The plot of this movie is that Mr Bean (of ALL people!) is asked to present a speech on Whistler's portrait of his mother in America. The person who is curating also has the idea to have him stay with his family. So the plot is extremely thin. If you've seen the show you might know what to expect. I enjoyed Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean and everyone does their absolute best but there are a few complaints. Firstly. Mr Bean is a character that relies on pure physical comedy and not really that much else. His child-like antics are okay to watch for 30 minutes but this is nearly 90 minutes. It does get tiring after a while. Aside from that this is not that bad. It isn't anything special but it isn't unwatchable either. If you like the TV show then this is certainly worth a try.

    Bean is a really great comedy to watch. The premise is really great, and tell me if your going to like this; Mr.Bean works at the Royal gallery of London, and his bosses want to fire him, but is denied by the chairman, desperate to get rid off him they send him to America to review whistler's mother, that the Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Now what I love about the movie is the humor, they keep the nostalgia of Mr.Bean, they still have the turkey gag, that is great, they even have the blowing up an airsickness bag gag to, and bits with Mr.Bean are funny, like the bit where he mistakenly flips people off the people in LA. The flaw with this film is the family, they pretty much find him weird when they first meet him, and also judge him before they even meet him and saying that British people are wried. But its still is Mr. Bean, if you know and like Mr. Bean, you'll love this film.

    "Bean" was a huge part of my childhood. I'd watch it almost as much as "Mrs. Doubtfire" so I'm going to be extremely bias in my opinions. Sorry. We all know that Mr.Bean is a love it or hate it character (how could anyone hate?) I for one, LOVE Mr.Bean and find his farcical, childish and downright simple behaviour absolutely hilarious. We all know that doing a film based on a TV series isn't always such a great idea too, but here "Bean" absolutely pulls it off. The only thing wrong with the film is that is simply isn't long enough. Watching all the fantastic deleted scenes devastates me that they didn't include them in. "Bean" is one hilarious sequence after another, with actually a surprisingly great plot and some nice character development on the Langley family. Frankly is you the handkerchief scene doesn't make you laugh (eat you heart out Othello!) or even the drying the wet patch scene and the scene after that, then you know that Mr.Bean is not for you. The idea of Mr.Bean destroying America's greatest painting is a stroke of genius and it really is a hilarious sight to behold, as well as conveying a feeling of absolute disastrous terror! "Bean" also has a really fantastic sweeping score that I think deserves to have been Oscar-nominated! Rowan Atkinson also puts on another faultless performance as the character, and whilst the film isn't exactly perfect, it's still an absolutely hilarious and entertaining farce that flies by. So please don't get all superficial about "Bean" because it does exactly what it sets out to do.

    I saw this and could not stop laughing. I liked it because they took things from the TV show and put it in the movie. Spoilers. The way he messed up the painting was one of the funniest thing I had ever seen. The random underwear in the oven scene was so funny. The tissue up his nose is funny. There are so many more things that are in this movie that make me laugh all the time. When ever you see Mr. Bean in a situation where is alone that a major indication something very funny is about to happen. When he is mistaken to be a genius when he knows very little about paintings is always funny. The shower scene is great. This movie is packed with humor that is just as hilarious as it was the first time when watching it multiple times. The painting scene will defiantly cause a serious amount of laughter. This is my favorite comedy. This is very good.

The mayhem begins in flight when Bean pops a bag of vomit on a first class customer during cruise. Only Bean can make such a mistake. Whilst Bean is in flight, Langley is trying to convince his son and daughter about the scholar staying over at their place during his visit to LA. Alison Langley (Pamela Reed) who is not too thrilled about the whole idea gives her husband the benefit of the doubt. Soon they are about to find out how wrong they all were. Now it all is clear to me and now I am beginning to understand what viewers felt back in 1997. Disappointment! Hardly hitting Average!

    The TV series is a classic of a comedy series, so naturally this film had a lot to live up to. It comes close, but overall it isn't a patch on the TV series. Starting with the few I had, the plot is rather generic and somewhat predictable in areas too, and I think while making an effort to stick to the spirit of the series is rather thin for the running time. Also some of the melodrama is rather sappy for my tastes. On the other hand, the film does look great, so is the soundtrack, the physical comedy is laugh-out-loud-funny, Peter MacNicol is good in his conventional role and Rowan Atkinson is brilliant as Mr Bean. All in all, there is much to enjoy but it does fall short of the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    My late aunt and I both loved the "Mr. Bean" TV show, though my mother hated it, so my aunt and I eagerly went to the movie theater to see it. This was a box office hit? All it did was recycle some jokes from the TV show, add a stupid plot and a stupid supporting cast, and leave out the charm and cleverness. The idea of the TV show was that Mr. Bean used ingenious ways to deal with various situations, with varying degrees of success. Here he just acts like an idiot, and serves as the villain rather than the hero of the story. The one amusing bit in the movie (for which I gave an extra star) was where he distracted the security guard, then used laxatives to keep him away from his post for a sufficient time. But even then, it's the guard and not Mr. Bean who gets the laughs. We were both quite disappointed, and nobody else in the theater except for a little boy sitting next to me seemed to have any fun.

    First of all I was shocked to see how badly the movie was rated.Man it was rated 5.8 how could it be.This is one of the finest masterpiece of comedy from Mr. Rowan Atkinson.Hats off to you! My review 8/10 go for this one!!!!! His comedy does not look artificial he is so natural & comfortable while portraying his character.The story line was okay but only & only Mr.Atkinson gave it a superb zeal by his performance. Other actors did their job ,okay.The best thing about the movie is that you will enjoy it as a comic cracker also you will be glued to the seat anxiously thinking what is going to be the next disaster by Mr. Bean If u didn't get my point it's my fault because I haven't made the synopsis of this movie clear . For that you will have to watch it. I can say that You will enjoy it thoroughly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    I grew up watching Mr. Bean when I was little on HBO and I LOVE(D) IT!! Still a die-hard fan today. I remember my dad rented this movie for me when I was 6 years old and I cracked up for hours!! This movie also has a great plot involving Mr. Bean going to L.A. to "baby-sit" Whistler's Mother, a well-known painting who has finally returned to America at last for 2 months after his bosses fire him for not doing his job at the Royal National Gallery. I would have to say, if you love Rowan Atkinson and Mr. Bean and have never seen this movie before, I'd say WATCH IT! An excellent movie for the whole family (and friends)!!! A film every Mr. Bean fan should see!!! 10/10: a hilarious movie.

    Mr Bean, Rowan Atkinson's most iconic role. There was clearly going to be a movie because the child-like antics of the character clearly was popular enough. In my eyes it doesn't translate well to the screen but this is certainly worth a watch. The plot of this movie is that Mr Bean (of ALL people!) is asked to present a speech on Whistler's portrait of his mother in America. The person who is curating also has the idea to have him stay with his family. So the plot is extremely thin. If you've seen the show you might know what to expect. I enjoyed Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean and everyone does their absolute best but there are a few complaints. Firstly. Mr Bean is a character that relies on pure physical comedy and not really that much else. His child-like antics are okay to watch for 30 minutes but this is nearly 90 minutes. It does get tiring after a while. Aside from that this is not that bad. It isn't anything special but it isn't unwatchable either. If you like the TV show then this is certainly worth a try.

    Bean is a really great comedy to watch. The premise is really great, and tell me if your going to like this; Mr.Bean works at the Royal gallery of London, and his bosses want to fire him, but is denied by the chairman, desperate to get rid off him they send him to America to review whistler's mother, that the Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Now what I love about the movie is the humor, they keep the nostalgia of Mr.Bean, they still have the turkey gag, that is great, they even have the blowing up an airsickness bag gag to, and bits with Mr.Bean are funny, like the bit where he mistakenly flips people off the people in LA. The flaw with this film is the family, they pretty much find him weird when they first meet him, and also judge him before they even meet him and saying that British people are wried. But its still is Mr. Bean, if you know and like Mr. Bean, you'll love this film.

    "Bean" was a huge part of my childhood. I'd watch it almost as much as "Mrs. Doubtfire" so I'm going to be extremely bias in my opinions. Sorry. We all know that Mr.Bean is a love it or hate it character (how could anyone hate?) I for one, LOVE Mr.Bean and find his farcical, childish and downright simple behaviour absolutely hilarious. We all know that doing a film based on a TV series isn't always such a great idea too, but here "Bean" absolutely pulls it off. The only thing wrong with the film is that is simply isn't long enough. Watching all the fantastic deleted scenes devastates me that they didn't include them in. "Bean" is one hilarious sequence after another, with actually a surprisingly great plot and some nice character development on the Langley family. Frankly is you the handkerchief scene doesn't make you laugh (eat you heart out Othello!) or even the drying the wet patch scene and the scene after that, then you know that Mr.Bean is not for you. The idea of Mr.Bean destroying America's greatest painting is a stroke of genius and it really is a hilarious sight to behold, as well as conveying a feeling of absolute disastrous terror! "Bean" also has a really fantastic sweeping score that I think deserves to have been Oscar-nominated! Rowan Atkinson also puts on another faultless performance as the character, and whilst the film isn't exactly perfect, it's still an absolutely hilarious and entertaining farce that flies by. So please don't get all superficial about "Bean" because it does exactly what it sets out to do.

    I saw this and could not stop laughing. I liked it because they took things from the TV show and put it in the movie. Spoilers. The way he messed up the painting was one of the funniest thing I had ever seen. The random underwear in the oven scene was so funny. The tissue up his nose is funny. There are so many more things that are in this movie that make me laugh all the time. When ever you see Mr. Bean in a situation where is alone that a major indication something very funny is about to happen. When he is mistaken to be a genius when he knows very little about paintings is always funny. The shower scene is great. This movie is packed with humor that is just as hilarious as it was the first time when watching it multiple times. The painting scene will defiantly cause a serious amount of laughter. This is my favorite comedy. This is very good.

    I couldn't believe when I saw the review that this movie was rated at a mere 5.9!!!!!.....I am a BIG fan of the Mr. Bean TV series and if you have seen it, you will know that Rowan Atkinson pulls off a splendid performance in each and every episode. As it is said for Tom and Jerry, it can be rightly said for Mr. Bean that action speaks louder than words.....Each and every Bean episode is filled with hilarity and Atkinson manages to do all that just be speaking a handful of words which is not the case with many modern day comedy shows where a lot of dialogs are needed. My suggestion is that if you are looking for a really nice movie with a lot of laughs and no complicated dialogs, RENT THIS ONE!!!!....It will be much more fun if you see if with someone who likes to laugh!!..... Mr. Bean ROCKS!!!.....

    When comedy was ruled by Jim Carrey back in the 90s, this movie was quite a welcome change. Although she does not deliver as much as we expect for a Bean movie! When Rowan Atkinson and Peter Macnicol (Ally Mcbeal, 24) team up together laughter does happen. Atkinson in particular is excellent; however I feel if he spoke more rather than stick to his silent movie approach the movie would have been more successful than it is. Expectations were quite high back in 1997 when this initially took over the cinemas and what feedback it got back in the day I am not very familiar with. No introduction is needed on this one. Since the British TV show Mr. Bean was aired in 1990, Bean has been a household name and the chances are a majority of the entire world has seen at least one episode of him. This wondrous story of a Man child is a creation of Rowan Atkinson himself. So what can you expect you pack it all up into one movie? Mel Smith, who took up the screen play that was done by Rowan Atkinson, is given a fairly arduous task I must say. This script is not the sharpest script written by Atkinson based on Mr. Bean. His intended humor was obviously that of the acting of Bean. However for those who are hardcore fans of the entire Mr. Bean franchise would have preferred a more original adaptation of the character. Something that will be done in the future with Johnny English Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) a caretaker at the British Royal National Gallery dodges a bullet when it is decided by the directors to send him to Los Angeles instead of firing him. The drawing of Whistlers Mother is apparently returning back to where she belongs - The United States. When David Langley (Peter Macnicol) decided to select a British art scholar instead of Bon Jovi to speak at the grand unveiling of the drawing, little did he know that Dr.Bean (he isn't a doctor really- I am sure you will figure that on your own) was what he has signed up for? The mayhem begins in flight when Bean pops a bag of vomit on a first class customer during cruise. Only Bean can make such a mistake.

Now it all is clear to me and now I am beginning to understand what viewers felt back in 1997. Disappointment! Hardly hitting Average!
