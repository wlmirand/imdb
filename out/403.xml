 <sinopse>
  The Dark Knight of Gotham City begins his war on crime with his first major enemy being the clownishly homicidal Joker.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Gotham City: dark, dangerous, 'protected' only by a mostly corrupt police department. Despite the best efforts of D.A. Harvey Dent and police commissioner Jim Gordon, the city becomes increasingly unsafe...until a Dark Knight arises. We all know criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot...so his disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. He becomes a bat. Enter Vicky Vale, a prize-winning photo journalist who wants to uncover the secret of the mysterious "bat-man". And enter Jack Napier, one-time enforcer for Boss Grissom, horribly disfigured after a firefight in a chemical factory...who, devoid of the last vestiges of sanity, seizes control of Gotham's underworld as the psychotic, unpredictable Clown Prince of Crime...the Joker. Gotham's only hope, it seems, lies in this dark, brooding vigilante. And just how does billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne fit into all of this?

    Batman '89 from Tim Burton, is the movie that made Superhero movies the big deal of the year as far as theater attendance is concerned. It's marketing and merchandising sales thus created a great hype surrounding the movie's release, as people were excited to see a different take on Batman in the movies, since the cultural phenomenon was generally known to film and t.v audiences in the form of the Adam West Batman show in the 60's. Then when the movie came out in summer of '89 it went on to become the biggest domestic release of the year. So, 25 years later The Batman franchise's success has gone through many changes some great, some not, but to get to the heart of it you have to look at this one. Being that my favorite film incarnation of Batman is The Dark Knight Trilogy, I can't say that this movie had much of an impact on me as an already huge Batman fan, but I still really like certain parts of it. Jack Nicholson as The Joker is good, he really had the duty of carrying the movie as far as the performances go with a screen time of more than sixty minutes (half the movie's runtime), you start to realize that he's actually the main actor of the show. This is the movie's biggest plus yet also what I think to be it's biggest flaw, really because this is supposed to be a movie about Batman, but instead of choosing to develop him, they choose to develop the big baddie of the schlock. Michael Keaton does have his moments in the cape and cowl that are cool (introduction scene), but really I think to care about what the man in the suit is doing you have to be invested in him without the suit as well, which they didn't do that great a job of in that aspect. Keaton's Bruce Wayne just feels so cold and distant, trying to be somewhat of an enigma yet also a bit psychotic which doesn't really allow to connect with him, and he doesn't really emote that much for you to feel pity. As far as the other character and actors of the movie, my feeling are a bit neutral. Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale probably isn't very necessary to the plot, and doesn't have much chemistry with Keaton (not surprising when you take into consideration that he ignores her for a big chink of it). The late Michael Gough was well cast as a more grandfatherly version of everyone's favorite butler Alfred, and I wish he had more to do in this. Robert Wuhl as the reporter Knox, really isn't that funny in the movie, which is a bit of a shame since he's a funny guy usually. Overall the cast, while not bad, was used half as much as they should have. The aesthetically, this is a very inspired movie, some of the Gotham city sets look spectacular it's very artsy in all of the gloomy tones you get from it, probably being Mr. Burton's best as far as production design is concerned. I'd be crazy not to mention Danny Elfman's score, which is definitely the best & most memorable part of the movie. The Batman Theme goes down as one of the greatest movie themes without a doubt, and am glad Elfman composed the opening to the wonderful Animated Series. When watching the film's technicalities, which may not come of as impressive today which is understandable, you can't help but be a little awestruck at some of the interesting visuals in it. As a huge Batman fan I can say while this is a heavily flawed movie, I can still be entertained by parts of it. If you didn't grow up with this version of Batman, you might be a little disappointed at some of the things you've come to love in lots of the various incarnations of Batman, but it can be an interesting one to watch. 7/10

    Hello fellow readers, welcome to another movie review, this time about my favorite Batman film of the franchise. Here it begins, if you enjoyed you can check out my review for Batman Returns (1992)So, the great film begins with a family lost in Gotham City which was designed very nicely in this film. They walk down in an eerie old alleyway only to be held up by some thugs. The film already gets exciting at this point for me. While atop a building, one of the thugs gets a weird feeling that the Batman is close by after reading many news articles about the strange man or thing. They suddenly hear a noise behind them thus showing us the Batman in costume, fighting very originally. Danny Elfman's musical score in this scene just matches with what is going on. After a cool briefing with a news reporter and a corrupt cop named Eckhart we then get our first scene of Jack Napier/ The Joker played here by Jack Nicholson, I really think this was one of his most iconic roles in a film. Anyway, there's like a party at Bruce Wayne's mansion which shows us Michael Keaton acting as Bruce Wayne for the first time. I must admit that Keaton was the best man to fit into the bat suit but Christian Bale was the best Bruce Wayne for sure. Commissioner Gordon gets a tip from a rookie of reported sightings of Jack Napier searching the Axis Chemical factory for Harvey Dent's files. I was really hoping that Harvey Dent would become Two-Face in the film watching it for the first time but when I realized why The Joker was intentionally meant to be the only villain that thought vanished. After a conversation between the reporter from before and Viki Vale played by Kim Basinger with Bruce Wayne, Alfred shows up and tells Bruce about Commissioner Gordan's tip which calls for more BATMAN action. We then get the action scene in Axis Chemicals which might be one of my favorite moments in the film. It is here that Jack Napier falls into a vat of green chemicals which alters him into his new insane identity, THE JOKER. But I really did like him when he was just Jack Napier. Batman is thought to be the reason of why Jack fell in and the police nearly have him cornered but there's always a helpful gadget along with Batman. Meanwhile Jack Napier is at his trusted surgeon to fix his face, then discovering his smiley face in a mirror. What follows is a first menacing laugh of the films villain. A day later at night time, Bruce is having a wonderful time with Viki on a date. The Joker then goes to his boss's apartment and shoots him several times in a very creative fashion. Stuff happens until we get a delightful scene with the Joker on TV advertising his new deadly products which menace the society of Gotham. Batman tries to cope with the matter while still keeping up with Viki. The two were meant to meet at an art gallery but as 3 Hours pass Bruce still isn't there. The Joker enters the scene and knocks out everyone with some purple gas, Viki manages to stay alive from the air device Joker had gift wrapped for her previously. Before things get bad Batman crashes through the glass window above heroically to save the day, we then get a car chase with the bat-mobile. Excitement follows and the next day Viki discovers the truth about Bruce, his parents were killed when he was young. She then finds out that Bruce is BATMAN who now finds out that Joker was the killer of his parents and that he must now confront and kill him with great vengeance. A cool bat-plane scene follows and we reach the films' slow point being the end church fight. The Joker dies creatively and we get a nice finishing scene with Batman standing proud and tall on a respective building. Though I have just read the story as messily as I could, you should really watch this great film. I always wonder, do I like this more than Batman Begins or not. Even if I did it would be strong second favorite. The film was nicely done by Tim Burton. It is just an awesome film which I really recommend you watch. If you enjoyed you can view my further reviews or my previous ones, see you soon.

    First of all, let me start about telling Batman's roots. The Batman we know today is different than the one Bob Kane and Bill Finger created. The original Batman didn't hesitate killing his enemies. He was not the kind of Hero we see today, he was a vigilante/hero. Batman nowadays is a hero/hero. The reason for why they made Batman stop killing his enemies, is because there was period in the old comics where Batman used a gun to kill a monster (if I remember correctly, it was a monster created by Professor Hugo Strange). It sounds strange, but the fact remains that it was how Bob Kane and Bill Finger envisioned Batman. Well with this film Batman has gone back to his vigilante roots. He doesn't get bothered by the fact that he is killing the bad guys. Also his motivation of Batman is to get revenge for his parents, by punishing criminals in a bat-suit. Which was like the original Batman. Michael Keaton made a perfect Batman in this Batman, his mysterious, dark yet human looks could not have fit more as Batman. Jack Nicholson was... Astonishing!! Kim Basinger was a good Vicki Vale, beautiful, headstrong yet vulnerable. Tim Burton's Gothic style could not have fit more to the world inside Batman. Realistic, but not realistic realistic, comic realistic. If it was too realistic, then it would have been... Ehm, Wrong. To be perfectly honest, I prefer Burton's Batman, rather than Nolan's Batman. Why...? Well, I already wrote down the reasons. One of my favorite films and definitely my favorite Batman. 10/10

    In this movie, we see a man dressed as a bat fighting the Joker. What we don't have is Batman against the Joker. This vigilante, oddly dressed, KILLS WITHOUT EVEN THINKING, has no fighting or intelligence skills and is surrounded by a bunch of idiots: Alfred, his butler that doesn't care about his master's double identity, Vale, a journalist/photograph/nobodycares, an anonymous Gordon and a...very strange Harvey Dent. Good music and scenarios, Nicholson amazing in a role that wasn't too right, good Keaton. The story was wrote by monkeys...and Tim Burton. Trust me: if you want an amazing Batman movie go watch "The Dark Knight Trilogy"

    In the late 1980's, producers were having trouble getting Batman on the big screen, luckily, dark visionist Tim Burton was there to give them a film that had great characters, great music, and a great look: All of these things were handled some of the best ever in cinematic history. Batman is refreshingly different from other superhero films, it keeps the character mysterious, and this suits his character perfectly. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the Joker: Loud, attention-craving, and hilarious. The cast is great, having a good love interest in Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale along with classic supporting actors like Robert Wuhl, Jack Palance, Tracey Walter, and Michael Gough. Danny Elfman's score is...in a word...incredible. Music is very important to storytelling and vice versa, the two things enhance each other immensely in this film. The production design perfectly sums up the realism of its characters and its own universe: It's fantastic, but not realistic, and it shouldn't be realistic, too many people forget the core concept is a man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime. The Batman series would go through many sequels and reboots of varying degrees of underrated and overrated, but none matched Batman, and most likely, none will. The closest we got, and close it is indeed, is its sequel Batman Returns.

    I must have been in the wrong mood to watch this film, a tired and mostly uninterested one, because I was extremely disappointed by it. Perhaps I wasn't keen because I'd seen and adored the Nolan trilogy so much, and thought that was the only way Batman should be done. Perhaps it was just too camp and over the top for me. Honestly, it could have been any of these, or a combination of them and various other things, but I just didn't enjoy this film very much. The film does work on a few levels, however, and it is these that I want to focus on, because there were some positive parts. Firstly, the film is pretty dark for its time, although nowhere near the levels of "The Dark Knight". The Joker's violence is pretty grim and stands out in a film which is made up of a lot of flair. The Joker's character itself is probably the best part of this film, and Jack Nicholson shines in the role. Having seen Heath Ledger's performance a number of times, I expected to be disappointed by Nicholson, but I felt completely the opposite. He added a completely different side to the Joker, going for violent sinister rather than psychological sinister, and I do think that they worked as well as each other. A lot of the action in the film is engaging and fun too, especially some of the Batman fight scenes. Now for the main problems in the film. Michael Keaton's take on the "Caped Crusader" was, to me, fairly uninteresting and felt like it had been completely masked by Nicholson's brilliance. I did enjoy Danny Elfman's score, and think that it was much better than Hans Zimmer attempts for the recent trilogy, but it was Prince's contribution which annoyed me the most. For a film which was trying to have at least a bit of seriousness among the dark comedy, the overly campy songs that filled the movie destroyed some of the darkness, being too lively and upbeat. The main problem in reviewing this film is that it has a remake which, for once, is far superior to the original, and now has such great renown that it's impossible to see one without comparing it to the other. I do wonder how I would have judged the film if I had never seen the "Dark Knight" trilogy, but I imagine my view would be fairly similar. And if this is supposed to be the best (or second best in some opinions) of the originals, I honestly fear how bad "Batman and Robin" must be.

    I remember back in 1989, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the pick of comedic actor Michael Keaton to play Bruce Wayne/Batman, and if director Tim Burton would turn this into a farce, as they had "Beetle Juice" the previous year, but those fears were unfounded, as Mr. Keaton was properly complex and brooding as Billionaire Bruce Wayne, whose secret identity of Batman enables him to clean up the corrupt streets of Gotham. His chief nemesis is Jack Napier/The Joker, who is the opposite of him; extrovert to his introvert, evil to his good, but there turns out to be a deeper connection than either man realizes until the end... Magnificent production, very detailed and Gothic take on Gotham, a mix of 1930's and 1980's styles. Fantastic action, and solid script make this a winner, even if the soundtrack by Prince is a bit incongruous to the setting. Otherwise, a triumph.

    The very first film in the franchise. I really loved the first Batman film. My experience was awesome. It kept me entertained the whole time. A great beginning. Nice and quick. The costuming was amazing. The acting was right on key, the direction and flow was awesome. And the music was just brilliant. It's everything you want to see in an action film. Trust me it's the bomb. This is the best Batman film out of all of the movies. Everything was great. The acting, the script, the special effects. Everything was a well done job. The filmmakers for once should be very proud of themselves. It was a great one. So everyone who's a fan of Bob Kane and Batman. They will not be disappointed. This film on DVD and Blu-ray will have you wanting to see all of the other Batman movies. Even though the rest of them aren't as good. So definitely a 10/10. Watch it and have a great time.

    As we all know, Tim Burton likes to use his imagination which is always out of the box. Batman is a good representation of the darker life of Batman. Not just the guy who everybody loves and adores. In this movie he is feared by everyone, not just the criminals. Micheal Keaton looks good in the bat suite, but as Bruce Wayne, not so much. He's voice as batman isn't really intimidating and a few cheesy lines doesn't quite fit the bill. Jack Nicholsen is the Joker, without any make up or movie magic he would still have looked like the joker! He's laugh is excellent and scary. He plays the role well and makes the movie what it is. Some parts of the movie could have been changed a bit. Like a bit more detail on how and why Bruce became batman? But at least the bat mobile and the bat wing looks cool. Batman uses his rappelling hook one to many times and that irritates me a lot. Overall it is a good representative of who the fearsome batman really is.

    THE GOOD: I rather like the 1989 Batman. Though realism pervades in the acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy, I prefer the Gothic expressionism of this earlier film. The look of Gotham hearkens back to Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), an oppressive city filled with pollution, oppression, and crime. In fact, the art direction is the best part of the whole film. I love how the ending is staged, obviously a throwback to Vertigo (1958). I love Danny Elfman's score, simultaneously heroic and twisted. THE MEH: Michael Keaton is both a good and bad Batman. His Bruce Wayne is excellent in that you would never expect him to be the Caped Crusader, and he does the whole brooding thing well. The problem is he physically does not fit the character. Also, his Bruce Wayne is a bit too Clark Kent-ish. THE UGLY: Kim Basinger gets stuck playing Vicky Vale, a character who exists only as an object for Batman and the Joker to brawl over. She's occasionally useful and at first serves as a stand-in for the audience as she learns more about the mysterious Bruce Wayne, but that role erodes over time and by the end she's just your garden variety damsel in distress whose every other line is a shrill scream. The script is atrocious. I understand the Joker's plan is intended to be chaotic, but the way the story is told is so clumsy. We don't know enough about the characters to care about them, especially Batman himself who gets little screen time in comparison to the Joker and Vicky. Perhaps they intended to make Batman more mysterious as a result, but there's a fine line between mysterious and vague, and they've crossed over that line. IN CONCLUSION: The atmosphere and art direction are great, but don't expect much depth in the way of story or character.

Kim Basinger was a good Vicki Vale, beautiful, headstrong yet vulnerable. Tim Burton's Gothic style could not have fit more to the world inside Batman. Realistic, but not realistic realistic, comic realistic. If it was too realistic, then it would have been... Ehm, Wrong. To be perfectly honest, I prefer Burton's Batman, rather than Nolan's Batman. Why...? Well, I already wrote down the reasons. One of my favorite films and definitely my favorite Batman. 10/10

    In this movie, we see a man dressed as a bat fighting the Joker. What we don't have is Batman against the Joker. This vigilante, oddly dressed, KILLS WITHOUT EVEN THINKING, has no fighting or intelligence skills and is surrounded by a bunch of idiots: Alfred, his butler that doesn't care about his master's double identity, Vale, a journalist/photograph/nobodycares, an anonymous Gordon and a...very strange Harvey Dent. Good music and scenarios, Nicholson amazing in a role that wasn't too right, good Keaton. The story was wrote by monkeys...and Tim Burton. Trust me: if you want an amazing Batman movie go watch "The Dark Knight Trilogy"

    In the late 1980's, producers were having trouble getting Batman on the big screen, luckily, dark visionist Tim Burton was there to give them a film that had great characters, great music, and a great look: All of these things were handled some of the best ever in cinematic history. Batman is refreshingly different from other superhero films, it keeps the character mysterious, and this suits his character perfectly. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the Joker: Loud, attention-craving, and hilarious. The cast is great, having a good love interest in Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale along with classic supporting actors like Robert Wuhl, Jack Palance, Tracey Walter, and Michael Gough. Danny Elfman's score is...in a word...incredible. Music is very important to storytelling and vice versa, the two things enhance each other immensely in this film. The production design perfectly sums up the realism of its characters and its own universe: It's fantastic, but not realistic, and it shouldn't be realistic, too many people forget the core concept is a man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime. The Batman series would go through many sequels and reboots of varying degrees of underrated and overrated, but none matched Batman, and most likely, none will. The closest we got, and close it is indeed, is its sequel Batman Returns.

    I must have been in the wrong mood to watch this film, a tired and mostly uninterested one, because I was extremely disappointed by it. Perhaps I wasn't keen because I'd seen and adored the Nolan trilogy so much, and thought that was the only way Batman should be done. Perhaps it was just too camp and over the top for me. Honestly, it could have been any of these, or a combination of them and various other things, but I just didn't enjoy this film very much. The film does work on a few levels, however, and it is these that I want to focus on, because there were some positive parts. Firstly, the film is pretty dark for its time, although nowhere near the levels of "The Dark Knight". The Joker's violence is pretty grim and stands out in a film which is made up of a lot of flair. The Joker's character itself is probably the best part of this film, and Jack Nicholson shines in the role. Having seen Heath Ledger's performance a number of times, I expected to be disappointed by Nicholson, but I felt completely the opposite. He added a completely different side to the Joker, going for violent sinister rather than psychological sinister, and I do think that they worked as well as each other. A lot of the action in the film is engaging and fun too, especially some of the Batman fight scenes. Now for the main problems in the film. Michael Keaton's take on the "Caped Crusader" was, to me, fairly uninteresting and felt like it had been completely masked by Nicholson's brilliance. I did enjoy Danny Elfman's score, and think that it was much better than Hans Zimmer attempts for the recent trilogy, but it was Prince's contribution which annoyed me the most. For a film which was trying to have at least a bit of seriousness among the dark comedy, the overly campy songs that filled the movie destroyed some of the darkness, being too lively and upbeat. The main problem in reviewing this film is that it has a remake which, for once, is far superior to the original, and now has such great renown that it's impossible to see one without comparing it to the other. I do wonder how I would have judged the film if I had never seen the "Dark Knight" trilogy, but I imagine my view would be fairly similar. And if this is supposed to be the best (or second best in some opinions) of the originals, I honestly fear how bad "Batman and Robin" must be.

    I remember back in 1989, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the pick of comedic actor Michael Keaton to play Bruce Wayne/Batman, and if director Tim Burton would turn this into a farce, as they had "Beetle Juice" the previous year, but those fears were unfounded, as Mr. Keaton was properly complex and brooding as Billionaire Bruce Wayne, whose secret identity of Batman enables him to clean up the corrupt streets of Gotham. His chief nemesis is Jack Napier/The Joker, who is the opposite of him; extrovert to his introvert, evil to his good, but there turns out to be a deeper connection than either man realizes until the end... Magnificent production, very detailed and Gothic take on Gotham, a mix of 1930's and 1980's styles. Fantastic action, and solid script make this a winner, even if the soundtrack by Prince is a bit incongruous to the setting. Otherwise, a triumph.

    The very first film in the franchise. I really loved the first Batman film. My experience was awesome. It kept me entertained the whole time. A great beginning. Nice and quick. The costuming was amazing. The acting was right on key, the direction and flow was awesome. And the music was just brilliant. It's everything you want to see in an action film. Trust me it's the bomb. This is the best Batman film out of all of the movies. Everything was great. The acting, the script, the special effects. Everything was a well done job. The filmmakers for once should be very proud of themselves. It was a great one. So everyone who's a fan of Bob Kane and Batman. They will not be disappointed. This film on DVD and Blu-ray will have you wanting to see all of the other Batman movies. Even though the rest of them aren't as good. So definitely a 10/10. Watch it and have a great time.

    As we all know, Tim Burton likes to use his imagination which is always out of the box. Batman is a good representation of the darker life of Batman. Not just the guy who everybody loves and adores. In this movie he is feared by everyone, not just the criminals. Micheal Keaton looks good in the bat suite, but as Bruce Wayne, not so much. He's voice as batman isn't really intimidating and a few cheesy lines doesn't quite fit the bill. Jack Nicholsen is the Joker, without any make up or movie magic he would still have looked like the joker! He's laugh is excellent and scary. He plays the role well and makes the movie what it is. Some parts of the movie could have been changed a bit. Like a bit more detail on how and why Bruce became batman? But at least the bat mobile and the bat wing looks cool. Batman uses his rappelling hook one to many times and that irritates me a lot. Overall it is a good representative of who the fearsome batman really is.

    THE GOOD: I rather like the 1989 Batman. Though realism pervades in the acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy, I prefer the Gothic expressionism of this earlier film. The look of Gotham hearkens back to Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), an oppressive city filled with pollution, oppression, and crime. In fact, the art direction is the best part of the whole film. I love how the ending is staged, obviously a throwback to Vertigo (1958). I love Danny Elfman's score, simultaneously heroic and twisted. THE MEH: Michael Keaton is both a good and bad Batman. His Bruce Wayne is excellent in that you would never expect him to be the Caped Crusader, and he does the whole brooding thing well. The problem is he physically does not fit the character. Also, his Bruce Wayne is a bit too Clark Kent-ish. THE UGLY: Kim Basinger gets stuck playing Vicky Vale, a character who exists only as an object for Batman and the Joker to brawl over. She's occasionally useful and at first serves as a stand-in for the audience as she learns more about the mysterious Bruce Wayne, but that role erodes over time and by the end she's just your garden variety damsel in distress whose every other line is a shrill scream. The script is atrocious. I understand the Joker's plan is intended to be chaotic, but the way the story is told is so clumsy. We don't know enough about the characters to care about them, especially Batman himself who gets little screen time in comparison to the Joker and Vicky. Perhaps they intended to make Batman more mysterious as a result, but there's a fine line between mysterious and vague, and they've crossed over that line. IN CONCLUSION: The atmosphere and art direction are great, but don't expect much depth in the way of story or character.

    Batman '89 from Tim Burton, is the movie that made Superhero movies the big deal of the year as far as theater attendance is concerned. It's marketing and merchandising sales thus created a great hype surrounding the movie's release, as people were excited to see a different take on Batman in the movies, since the cultural phenomenon was generally known to film and t.v audiences in the form of the Adam West Batman show in the 60's. Then when the movie came out in summer of '89 it went on to become the biggest domestic release of the year. So, 25 years later The Batman franchise's success has gone through many changes some great, some not, but to get to the heart of it you have to look at this one. Being that my favorite film incarnation of Batman is The Dark Knight Trilogy, I can't say that this movie had much of an impact on me as an already huge Batman fan, but I still really like certain parts of it. Jack Nicholson as The Joker is good, he really had the duty of carrying the movie as far as the performances go with a screen time of more than sixty minutes (half the movie's runtime), you start to realize that he's actually the main actor of the show. This is the movie's biggest plus yet also what I think to be it's biggest flaw, really because this is supposed to be a movie about Batman, but instead of choosing to develop him, they choose to develop the big baddie of the schlock. Michael Keaton does have his moments in the cape and cowl that are cool (introduction scene), but really I think to care about what the man in the suit is doing you have to be invested in him without the suit as well, which they didn't do that great a job of in that aspect. Keaton's Bruce Wayne just feels so cold and distant, trying to be somewhat of an enigma yet also a bit psychotic which doesn't really allow to connect with him, and he doesn't really emote that much for you to feel pity. As far as the other character and actors of the movie, my feeling are a bit neutral. Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale probably isn't very necessary to the plot, and doesn't have much chemistry with Keaton (not surprising when you take into consideration that he ignores her for a big chink of it). The late Michael Gough was well cast as a more grandfatherly version of everyone's favorite butler Alfred, and I wish he had more to do in this. Robert Wuhl as the reporter Knox, really isn't that funny in the movie, which is a bit of a shame since he's a funny guy usually. Overall the cast, while not bad, was used half as much as they should have. The aesthetically, this is a very inspired movie, some of the Gotham city sets look spectacular it's very artsy in all of the gloomy tones you get from it, probably being Mr. Burton's best as far as production design is concerned. I'd be crazy not to mention Danny Elfman's score, which is definitely the best & most memorable part of the movie. The Batman Theme goes down as one of the greatest movie themes without a doubt, and am glad Elfman composed the opening to the wonderful Animated Series. When watching the film's technicalities, which may not come of as impressive today which is understandable, you can't help but be a little awestruck at some of the interesting visuals in it. As a huge Batman fan I can say while this is a heavily flawed movie, I can still be entertained by parts of it. If you didn't grow up with this version of Batman, you might be a little disappointed at some of the things you've come to love in lots of the various incarnations of Batman, but it can be an interesting one to watch. 7/10

    Hello fellow readers, welcome to another movie review, this time about my favorite Batman film of the franchise. Here it begins, if you enjoyed you can check out my review for Batman Returns (1992)So, the great film begins with a family lost in Gotham City which was designed very nicely in this film. They walk down in an eerie old alleyway only to be held up by some thugs. The film already gets exciting at this point for me. While atop a building, one of the thugs gets a weird feeling that the Batman is close by after reading many news articles about the strange man or thing. They suddenly hear a noise behind them thus showing us the Batman in costume, fighting very originally. Danny Elfman's musical score in this scene just matches with what is going on. After a cool briefing with a news reporter and a corrupt cop named Eckhart we then get our first scene of Jack Napier/ The Joker played here by Jack Nicholson, I really think this was one of his most iconic roles in a film. Anyway, there's like a party at Bruce Wayne's mansion which shows us Michael Keaton acting as Bruce Wayne for the first time. I must admit that Keaton was the best man to fit into the bat suit but Christian Bale was the best Bruce Wayne for sure. Commissioner Gordon gets a tip from a rookie of reported sightings of Jack Napier searching the Axis Chemical factory for Harvey Dent's files. I was really hoping that Harvey Dent would become Two-Face in the film watching it for the first time but when I realized why The Joker was intentionally meant to be the only villain that thought vanished. After a conversation between the reporter from before and Viki Vale played by Kim Basinger with Bruce Wayne, Alfred shows up and tells Bruce about Commissioner Gordan's tip which calls for more BATMAN action. We then get the action scene in Axis Chemicals which might be one of my favorite moments in the film. It is here that Jack Napier falls into a vat of green chemicals which alters him into his new insane identity, THE JOKER. But I really did like him when he was just Jack Napier. Batman is thought to be the reason of why Jack fell in and the police nearly have him cornered but there's always a helpful gadget along with Batman. Meanwhile Jack Napier is at his trusted surgeon to fix his face, then discovering his smiley face in a mirror. What follows is a first menacing laugh of the films villain. A day later at night time, Bruce is having a wonderful time with Viki on a date. The Joker then goes to his boss's apartment and shoots him several times in a very creative fashion. Stuff happens until we get a delightful scene with the Joker on TV advertising his new deadly products which menace the society of Gotham. Batman tries to cope with the matter while still keeping up with Viki. The two were meant to meet at an art gallery but as 3 Hours pass Bruce still isn't there. The Joker enters the scene and knocks out everyone with some purple gas, Viki manages to stay alive from the air device Joker had gift wrapped for her previously. Before things get bad Batman crashes through the glass window above heroically to save the day, we then get a car chase with the bat-mobile. Excitement follows and the next day Viki discovers the truth about Bruce, his parents were killed when he was young. She then finds out that Bruce is BATMAN who now finds out that Joker was the killer of his parents and that he must now confront and kill him with great vengeance. A cool bat-plane scene follows and we reach the films' slow point being the end church fight. The Joker dies creatively and we get a nice finishing scene with Batman standing proud and tall on a respective building. Though I have just read the story as messily as I could, you should really watch this great film. I always wonder, do I like this more than Batman Begins or not. Even if I did it would be strong second favorite. The film was nicely done by Tim Burton. It is just an awesome film which I really recommend you watch. If you enjoyed you can view my further reviews or my previous ones, see you soon.

    First of all, let me start about telling Batman's roots. The Batman we know today is different than the one Bob Kane and Bill Finger created. The original Batman didn't hesitate killing his enemies. He was not the kind of Hero we see today, he was a vigilante/hero. Batman nowadays is a hero/hero. The reason for why they made Batman stop killing his enemies, is because there was period in the old comics where Batman used a gun to kill a monster (if I remember correctly, it was a monster created by Professor Hugo Strange). It sounds strange, but the fact remains that it was how Bob Kane and Bill Finger envisioned Batman. Well with this film Batman has gone back to his vigilante roots. He doesn't get bothered by the fact that he is killing the bad guys. Also his motivation of Batman is to get revenge for his parents, by punishing criminals in a bat-suit. Which was like the original Batman. Michael Keaton made a perfect Batman in this Batman, his mysterious, dark yet human looks could not have fit more as Batman. Jack Nicholson was... Astonishing!! Kim Basinger was a good Vicki Vale, beautiful, headstrong yet vulnerable. Tim Burton's Gothic style could not have fit more to the world inside Batman. Realistic, but not realistic realistic, comic realistic. If it was too realistic, then it would have been... Ehm, Wrong. To be perfectly honest, I prefer Burton's Batman, rather than Nolan's Batman. Why...? Well, I already wrote down the reasons. One of my favorite films and definitely my favorite Batman. 10/10

Perhaps they intended to make Batman more mysterious as a result, but there's a fine line between mysterious and vague, and they've crossed over that line. IN CONCLUSION: The atmosphere and art direction are great, but don't expect much depth in the way of story or character.

    Batman '89 from Tim Burton, is the movie that made Superhero movies the big deal of the year as far as theater attendance is concerned. It's marketing and merchandising sales thus created a great hype surrounding the movie's release, as people were excited to see a different take on Batman in the movies, since the cultural phenomenon was generally known to film and t.v audiences in the form of the Adam West Batman show in the 60's. Then when the movie came out in summer of '89 it went on to become the biggest domestic release of the year. So, 25 years later The Batman franchise's success has gone through many changes some great, some not, but to get to the heart of it you have to look at this one. Being that my favorite film incarnation of Batman is The Dark Knight Trilogy, I can't say that this movie had much of an impact on me as an already huge Batman fan, but I still really like certain parts of it. Jack Nicholson as The Joker is good, he really had the duty of carrying the movie as far as the performances go with a screen time of more than sixty minutes (half the movie's runtime), you start to realize that he's actually the main actor of the show. This is the movie's biggest plus yet also what I think to be it's biggest flaw, really because this is supposed to be a movie about Batman, but instead of choosing to develop him, they choose to develop the big baddie of the schlock. Michael Keaton does have his moments in the cape and cowl that are cool (introduction scene), but really I think to care about what the man in the suit is doing you have to be invested in him without the suit as well, which they didn't do that great a job of in that aspect. Keaton's Bruce Wayne just feels so cold and distant, trying to be somewhat of an enigma yet also a bit psychotic which doesn't really allow to connect with him, and he doesn't really emote that much for you to feel pity. As far as the other character and actors of the movie, my feeling are a bit neutral. Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale probably isn't very necessary to the plot, and doesn't have much chemistry with Keaton (not surprising when you take into consideration that he ignores her for a big chink of it). The late Michael Gough was well cast as a more grandfatherly version of everyone's favorite butler Alfred, and I wish he had more to do in this. Robert Wuhl as the reporter Knox, really isn't that funny in the movie, which is a bit of a shame since he's a funny guy usually. Overall the cast, while not bad, was used half as much as they should have. The aesthetically, this is a very inspired movie, some of the Gotham city sets look spectacular it's very artsy in all of the gloomy tones you get from it, probably being Mr. Burton's best as far as production design is concerned. I'd be crazy not to mention Danny Elfman's score, which is definitely the best & most memorable part of the movie. The Batman Theme goes down as one of the greatest movie themes without a doubt, and am glad Elfman composed the opening to the wonderful Animated Series. When watching the film's technicalities, which may not come of as impressive today which is understandable, you can't help but be a little awestruck at some of the interesting visuals in it. As a huge Batman fan I can say while this is a heavily flawed movie, I can still be entertained by parts of it. If you didn't grow up with this version of Batman, you might be a little disappointed at some of the things you've come to love in lots of the various incarnations of Batman, but it can be an interesting one to watch. 7/10

    Hello fellow readers, welcome to another movie review, this time about my favorite Batman film of the franchise. Here it begins, if you enjoyed you can check out my review for Batman Returns (1992)So, the great film begins with a family lost in Gotham City which was designed very nicely in this film. They walk down in an eerie old alleyway only to be held up by some thugs. The film already gets exciting at this point for me. While atop a building, one of the thugs gets a weird feeling that the Batman is close by after reading many news articles about the strange man or thing. They suddenly hear a noise behind them thus showing us the Batman in costume, fighting very originally. Danny Elfman's musical score in this scene just matches with what is going on. After a cool briefing with a news reporter and a corrupt cop named Eckhart we then get our first scene of Jack Napier/ The Joker played here by Jack Nicholson, I really think this was one of his most iconic roles in a film. Anyway, there's like a party at Bruce Wayne's mansion which shows us Michael Keaton acting as Bruce Wayne for the first time. I must admit that Keaton was the best man to fit into the bat suit but Christian Bale was the best Bruce Wayne for sure. Commissioner Gordon gets a tip from a rookie of reported sightings of Jack Napier searching the Axis Chemical factory for Harvey Dent's files. I was really hoping that Harvey Dent would become Two-Face in the film watching it for the first time but when I realized why The Joker was intentionally meant to be the only villain that thought vanished. After a conversation between the reporter from before and Viki Vale played by Kim Basinger with Bruce Wayne, Alfred shows up and tells Bruce about Commissioner Gordan's tip which calls for more BATMAN action. We then get the action scene in Axis Chemicals which might be one of my favorite moments in the film. It is here that Jack Napier falls into a vat of green chemicals which alters him into his new insane identity, THE JOKER. But I really did like him when he was just Jack Napier. Batman is thought to be the reason of why Jack fell in and the police nearly have him cornered but there's always a helpful gadget along with Batman. Meanwhile Jack Napier is at his trusted surgeon to fix his face, then discovering his smiley face in a mirror. What follows is a first menacing laugh of the films villain. A day later at night time, Bruce is having a wonderful time with Viki on a date. The Joker then goes to his boss's apartment and shoots him several times in a very creative fashion. Stuff happens until we get a delightful scene with the Joker on TV advertising his new deadly products which menace the society of Gotham. Batman tries to cope with the matter while still keeping up with Viki. The two were meant to meet at an art gallery but as 3 Hours pass Bruce still isn't there. The Joker enters the scene and knocks out everyone with some purple gas, Viki manages to stay alive from the air device Joker had gift wrapped for her previously. Before things get bad Batman crashes through the glass window above heroically to save the day, we then get a car chase with the bat-mobile. Excitement follows and the next day Viki discovers the truth about Bruce, his parents were killed when he was young. She then finds out that Bruce is BATMAN who now finds out that Joker was the killer of his parents and that he must now confront and kill him with great vengeance. A cool bat-plane scene follows and we reach the films' slow point being the end church fight. The Joker dies creatively and we get a nice finishing scene with Batman standing proud and tall on a respective building. Though I have just read the story as messily as I could, you should really watch this great film. I always wonder, do I like this more than Batman Begins or not. Even if I did it would be strong second favorite. The film was nicely done by Tim Burton. It is just an awesome film which I really recommend you watch. If you enjoyed you can view my further reviews or my previous ones, see you soon.

    First of all, let me start about telling Batman's roots. The Batman we know today is different than the one Bob Kane and Bill Finger created. The original Batman didn't hesitate killing his enemies. He was not the kind of Hero we see today, he was a vigilante/hero. Batman nowadays is a hero/hero. The reason for why they made Batman stop killing his enemies, is because there was period in the old comics where Batman used a gun to kill a monster (if I remember correctly, it was a monster created by Professor Hugo Strange). It sounds strange, but the fact remains that it was how Bob Kane and Bill Finger envisioned Batman. Well with this film Batman has gone back to his vigilante roots. He doesn't get bothered by the fact that he is killing the bad guys. Also his motivation of Batman is to get revenge for his parents, by punishing criminals in a bat-suit. Which was like the original Batman. Michael Keaton made a perfect Batman in this Batman, his mysterious, dark yet human looks could not have fit more as Batman. Jack Nicholson was... Astonishing!! Kim Basinger was a good Vicki Vale, beautiful, headstrong yet vulnerable. Tim Burton's Gothic style could not have fit more to the world inside Batman. Realistic, but not realistic realistic, comic realistic. If it was too realistic, then it would have been... Ehm, Wrong. To be perfectly honest, I prefer Burton's Batman, rather than Nolan's Batman. Why...? Well, I already wrote down the reasons. One of my favorite films and definitely my favorite Batman. 10/10

    In this movie, we see a man dressed as a bat fighting the Joker. What we don't have is Batman against the Joker. This vigilante, oddly dressed, KILLS WITHOUT EVEN THINKING, has no fighting or intelligence skills and is surrounded by a bunch of idiots: Alfred, his butler that doesn't care about his master's double identity, Vale, a journalist/photograph/nobodycares, an anonymous Gordon and a...very strange Harvey Dent. Good music and scenarios, Nicholson amazing in a role that wasn't too right, good Keaton. The story was wrote by monkeys...and Tim Burton. Trust me: if you want an amazing Batman movie go watch "The Dark Knight Trilogy"

    In the late 1980's, producers were having trouble getting Batman on the big screen, luckily, dark visionist Tim Burton was there to give them a film that had great characters, great music, and a great look: All of these things were handled some of the best ever in cinematic history. Batman is refreshingly different from other superhero films, it keeps the character mysterious, and this suits his character perfectly. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the Joker: Loud, attention-craving, and hilarious. The cast is great, having a good love interest in Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale along with classic supporting actors like Robert Wuhl, Jack Palance, Tracey Walter, and Michael Gough. Danny Elfman's score is...in a word...incredible. Music is very important to storytelling and vice versa, the two things enhance each other immensely in this film. The production design perfectly sums up the realism of its characters and its own universe: It's fantastic, but not realistic, and it shouldn't be realistic, too many people forget the core concept is a man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime. The Batman series would go through many sequels and reboots of varying degrees of underrated and overrated, but none matched Batman, and most likely, none will. The closest we got, and close it is indeed, is its sequel Batman Returns.

    I must have been in the wrong mood to watch this film, a tired and mostly uninterested one, because I was extremely disappointed by it. Perhaps I wasn't keen because I'd seen and adored the Nolan trilogy so much, and thought that was the only way Batman should be done. Perhaps it was just too camp and over the top for me. Honestly, it could have been any of these, or a combination of them and various other things, but I just didn't enjoy this film very much. The film does work on a few levels, however, and it is these that I want to focus on, because there were some positive parts. Firstly, the film is pretty dark for its time, although nowhere near the levels of "The Dark Knight". The Joker's violence is pretty grim and stands out in a film which is made up of a lot of flair. The Joker's character itself is probably the best part of this film, and Jack Nicholson shines in the role. Having seen Heath Ledger's performance a number of times, I expected to be disappointed by Nicholson, but I felt completely the opposite. He added a completely different side to the Joker, going for violent sinister rather than psychological sinister, and I do think that they worked as well as each other. A lot of the action in the film is engaging and fun too, especially some of the Batman fight scenes. Now for the main problems in the film. Michael Keaton's take on the "Caped Crusader" was, to me, fairly uninteresting and felt like it had been completely masked by Nicholson's brilliance. I did enjoy Danny Elfman's score, and think that it was much better than Hans Zimmer attempts for the recent trilogy, but it was Prince's contribution which annoyed me the most. For a film which was trying to have at least a bit of seriousness among the dark comedy, the overly campy songs that filled the movie destroyed some of the darkness, being too lively and upbeat. The main problem in reviewing this film is that it has a remake which, for once, is far superior to the original, and now has such great renown that it's impossible to see one without comparing it to the other. I do wonder how I would have judged the film if I had never seen the "Dark Knight" trilogy, but I imagine my view would be fairly similar. And if this is supposed to be the best (or second best in some opinions) of the originals, I honestly fear how bad "Batman and Robin" must be.

    I remember back in 1989, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the pick of comedic actor Michael Keaton to play Bruce Wayne/Batman, and if director Tim Burton would turn this into a farce, as they had "Beetle Juice" the previous year, but those fears were unfounded, as Mr. Keaton was properly complex and brooding as Billionaire Bruce Wayne, whose secret identity of Batman enables him to clean up the corrupt streets of Gotham. His chief nemesis is Jack Napier/The Joker, who is the opposite of him; extrovert to his introvert, evil to his good, but there turns out to be a deeper connection than either man realizes until the end... Magnificent production, very detailed and Gothic take on Gotham, a mix of 1930's and 1980's styles. Fantastic action, and solid script make this a winner, even if the soundtrack by Prince is a bit incongruous to the setting. Otherwise, a triumph.

    The very first film in the franchise. I really loved the first Batman film. My experience was awesome. It kept me entertained the whole time. A great beginning. Nice and quick. The costuming was amazing. The acting was right on key, the direction and flow was awesome. And the music was just brilliant. It's everything you want to see in an action film. Trust me it's the bomb. This is the best Batman film out of all of the movies. Everything was great. The acting, the script, the special effects. Everything was a well done job. The filmmakers for once should be very proud of themselves. It was a great one. So everyone who's a fan of Bob Kane and Batman. They will not be disappointed. This film on DVD and Blu-ray will have you wanting to see all of the other Batman movies. Even though the rest of them aren't as good. So definitely a 10/10. Watch it and have a great time.

    As we all know, Tim Burton likes to use his imagination which is always out of the box. Batman is a good representation of the darker life of Batman. Not just the guy who everybody loves and adores. In this movie he is feared by everyone, not just the criminals. Micheal Keaton looks good in the bat suite, but as Bruce Wayne, not so much. He's voice as batman isn't really intimidating and a few cheesy lines doesn't quite fit the bill. Jack Nicholsen is the Joker, without any make up or movie magic he would still have looked like the joker! He's laugh is excellent and scary. He plays the role well and makes the movie what it is. Some parts of the movie could have been changed a bit. Like a bit more detail on how and why Bruce became batman? But at least the bat mobile and the bat wing looks cool. Batman uses his rappelling hook one to many times and that irritates me a lot. Overall it is a good representative of who the fearsome batman really is.

    THE GOOD: I rather like the 1989 Batman. Though realism pervades in the acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy, I prefer the Gothic expressionism of this earlier film. The look of Gotham hearkens back to Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), an oppressive city filled with pollution, oppression, and crime. In fact, the art direction is the best part of the whole film. I love how the ending is staged, obviously a throwback to Vertigo (1958). I love Danny Elfman's score, simultaneously heroic and twisted. THE MEH: Michael Keaton is both a good and bad Batman. His Bruce Wayne is excellent in that you would never expect him to be the Caped Crusader, and he does the whole brooding thing well. The problem is he physically does not fit the character. Also, his Bruce Wayne is a bit too Clark Kent-ish. THE UGLY: Kim Basinger gets stuck playing Vicky Vale, a character who exists only as an object for Batman and the Joker to brawl over. She's occasionally useful and at first serves as a stand-in for the audience as she learns more about the mysterious Bruce Wayne, but that role erodes over time and by the end she's just your garden variety damsel in distress whose every other line is a shrill scream. The script is atrocious. I understand the Joker's plan is intended to be chaotic, but the way the story is told is so clumsy. We don't know enough about the characters to care about them, especially Batman himself who gets little screen time in comparison to the Joker and Vicky. Perhaps they intended to make Batman more mysterious as a result, but there's a fine line between mysterious and vague, and they've crossed over that line. IN CONCLUSION: The atmosphere and art direction are great, but don't expect much depth in the way of story or character.

    In the late 1980's, producers were having trouble getting Batman on the big screen, luckily, dark visionist Tim Burton was there to give them a film that had great characters, great music, and a great look: All of these things were handled some of the best ever in cinematic history. Batman is refreshingly different from other superhero films, it keeps the character mysterious, and this suits his character perfectly. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the Joker: Loud, attention-craving, and hilarious. The cast is great, having a good love interest in Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale along with classic supporting actors like Robert Wuhl, Jack Palance, Tracey Walter, and Michael Gough. Danny Elfman's score is...in a word...incredible. Music is very important to storytelling and vice versa, the two things enhance each other immensely in this film. The production design perfectly sums up the realism of its characters and its own universe: It's fantastic, but not realistic, and it shouldn't be realistic, too many people forget the core concept is a man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime. The Batman series would go through many sequels and reboots of varying degrees of underrated and overrated, but none matched Batman, and most likely, none will. The closest we got, and close it is indeed, is its sequel Batman Returns.

    I must have been in the wrong mood to watch this film, a tired and mostly uninterested one, because I was extremely disappointed by it. Perhaps I wasn't keen because I'd seen and adored the Nolan trilogy so much, and thought that was the only way Batman should be done. Perhaps it was just too camp and over the top for me. Honestly, it could have been any of these, or a combination of them and various other things, but I just didn't enjoy this film very much. The film does work on a few levels, however, and it is these that I want to focus on, because there were some positive parts. Firstly, the film is pretty dark for its time, although nowhere near the levels of "The Dark Knight". The Joker's violence is pretty grim and stands out in a film which is made up of a lot of flair. The Joker's character itself is probably the best part of this film, and Jack Nicholson shines in the role. Having seen Heath Ledger's performance a number of times, I expected to be disappointed by Nicholson, but I felt completely the opposite. He added a completely different side to the Joker, going for violent sinister rather than psychological sinister, and I do think that they worked as well as each other. A lot of the action in the film is engaging and fun too, especially some of the Batman fight scenes. Now for the main problems in the film. Michael Keaton's take on the "Caped Crusader" was, to me, fairly uninteresting and felt like it had been completely masked by Nicholson's brilliance. I did enjoy Danny Elfman's score, and think that it was much better than Hans Zimmer attempts for the recent trilogy, but it was Prince's contribution which annoyed me the most. For a film which was trying to have at least a bit of seriousness among the dark comedy, the overly campy songs that filled the movie destroyed some of the darkness, being too lively and upbeat. The main problem in reviewing this film is that it has a remake which, for once, is far superior to the original, and now has such great renown that it's impossible to see one without comparing it to the other. I do wonder how I would have judged the film if I had never seen the "Dark Knight" trilogy, but I imagine my view would be fairly similar. And if this is supposed to be the best (or second best in some opinions) of the originals, I honestly fear how bad "Batman and Robin" must be.

    I remember back in 1989, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the pick of comedic actor Michael Keaton to play Bruce Wayne/Batman, and if director Tim Burton would turn this into a farce, as they had "Beetle Juice" the previous year, but those fears were unfounded, as Mr. Keaton was properly complex and brooding as Billionaire Bruce Wayne, whose secret identity of Batman enables him to clean up the corrupt streets of Gotham. His chief nemesis is Jack Napier/The Joker, who is the opposite of him; extrovert to his introvert, evil to his good, but there turns out to be a deeper connection than either man realizes until the end... Magnificent production, very detailed and Gothic take on Gotham, a mix of 1930's and 1980's styles. Fantastic action, and solid script make this a winner, even if the soundtrack by Prince is a bit incongruous to the setting. Otherwise, a triumph.

    The very first film in the franchise. I really loved the first Batman film. My experience was awesome. It kept me entertained the whole time. A great beginning. Nice and quick. The costuming was amazing. The acting was right on key, the direction and flow was awesome. And the music was just brilliant. It's everything you want to see in an action film. Trust me it's the bomb. This is the best Batman film out of all of the movies. Everything was great. The acting, the script, the special effects. Everything was a well done job. The filmmakers for once should be very proud of themselves. It was a great one. So everyone who's a fan of Bob Kane and Batman. They will not be disappointed. This film on DVD and Blu-ray will have you wanting to see all of the other Batman movies. Even though the rest of them aren't as good. So definitely a 10/10. Watch it and have a great time.

    As we all know, Tim Burton likes to use his imagination which is always out of the box. Batman is a good representation of the darker life of Batman. Not just the guy who everybody loves and adores. In this movie he is feared by everyone, not just the criminals. Micheal Keaton looks good in the bat suite, but as Bruce Wayne, not so much. He's voice as batman isn't really intimidating and a few cheesy lines doesn't quite fit the bill. Jack Nicholsen is the Joker, without any make up or movie magic he would still have looked like the joker! He's laugh is excellent and scary. He plays the role well and makes the movie what it is. Some parts of the movie could have been changed a bit. Like a bit more detail on how and why Bruce became batman? But at least the bat mobile and the bat wing looks cool. Batman uses his rappelling hook one to many times and that irritates me a lot. Overall it is a good representative of who the fearsome batman really is.

    THE GOOD: I rather like the 1989 Batman. Though realism pervades in the acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy, I prefer the Gothic expressionism of this earlier film. The look of Gotham hearkens back to Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), an oppressive city filled with pollution, oppression, and crime. In fact, the art direction is the best part of the whole film. I love how the ending is staged, obviously a throwback to Vertigo (1958). I love Danny Elfman's score, simultaneously heroic and twisted. THE MEH: Michael Keaton is both a good and bad Batman. His Bruce Wayne is excellent in that you would never expect him to be the Caped Crusader, and he does the whole brooding thing well. The problem is he physically does not fit the character. Also, his Bruce Wayne is a bit too Clark Kent-ish. THE UGLY: Kim Basinger gets stuck playing Vicky Vale, a character who exists only as an object for Batman and the Joker to brawl over. She's occasionally useful and at first serves as a stand-in for the audience as she learns more about the mysterious Bruce Wayne, but that role erodes over time and by the end she's just your garden variety damsel in distress whose every other line is a shrill scream. The script is atrocious. I understand the Joker's plan is intended to be chaotic, but the way the story is told is so clumsy. We don't know enough about the characters to care about them, especially Batman himself who gets little screen time in comparison to the Joker and Vicky. Perhaps they intended to make Batman more mysterious as a result, but there's a fine line between mysterious and vague, and they've crossed over that line. IN CONCLUSION: The atmosphere and art direction are great, but don't expect much depth in the way of story or character.

    Batman '89 from Tim Burton, is the movie that made Superhero movies the big deal of the year as far as theater attendance is concerned. It's marketing and merchandising sales thus created a great hype surrounding the movie's release, as people were excited to see a different take on Batman in the movies, since the cultural phenomenon was generally known to film and t.v audiences in the form of the Adam West Batman show in the 60's. Then when the movie came out in summer of '89 it went on to become the biggest domestic release of the year. So, 25 years later The Batman franchise's success has gone through many changes some great, some not, but to get to the heart of it you have to look at this one. Being that my favorite film incarnation of Batman is The Dark Knight Trilogy, I can't say that this movie had much of an impact on me as an already huge Batman fan, but I still really like certain parts of it. Jack Nicholson as The Joker is good, he really had the duty of carrying the movie as far as the performances go with a screen time of more than sixty minutes (half the movie's runtime), you start to realize that he's actually the main actor of the show. This is the movie's biggest plus yet also what I think to be it's biggest flaw, really because this is supposed to be a movie about Batman, but instead of choosing to develop him, they choose to develop the big baddie of the schlock. Michael Keaton does have his moments in the cape and cowl that are cool (introduction scene), but really I think to care about what the man in the suit is doing you have to be invested in him without the suit as well, which they didn't do that great a job of in that aspect. Keaton's Bruce Wayne just feels so cold and distant, trying to be somewhat of an enigma yet also a bit psychotic which doesn't really allow to connect with him, and he doesn't really emote that much for you to feel pity. As far as the other character and actors of the movie, my feeling are a bit neutral. Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale probably isn't very necessary to the plot, and doesn't have much chemistry with Keaton (not surprising when you take into consideration that he ignores her for a big chink of it). The late Michael Gough was well cast as a more grandfatherly version of everyone's favorite butler Alfred, and I wish he had more to do in this. Robert Wuhl as the reporter Knox, really isn't that funny in the movie, which is a bit of a shame since he's a funny guy usually. Overall the cast, while not bad, was used half as much as they should have. The aesthetically, this is a very inspired movie, some of the Gotham city sets look spectacular it's very artsy in all of the gloomy tones you get from it, probably being Mr. Burton's best as far as production design is concerned. I'd be crazy not to mention Danny Elfman's score, which is definitely the best & most memorable part of the movie. The Batman Theme goes down as one of the greatest movie themes without a doubt, and am glad Elfman composed the opening to the wonderful Animated Series. When watching the film's technicalities, which may not come of as impressive today which is understandable, you can't help but be a little awestruck at some of the interesting visuals in it. As a huge Batman fan I can say while this is a heavily flawed movie, I can still be entertained by parts of it. If you didn't grow up with this version of Batman, you might be a little disappointed at some of the things you've come to love in lots of the various incarnations of Batman, but it can be an interesting one to watch. 7/10

    Hello fellow readers, welcome to another movie review, this time about my favorite Batman film of the franchise. Here it begins, if you enjoyed you can check out my review for Batman Returns (1992)So, the great film begins with a family lost in Gotham City which was designed very nicely in this film. They walk down in an eerie old alleyway only to be held up by some thugs. The film already gets exciting at this point for me. While atop a building, one of the thugs gets a weird feeling that the Batman is close by after reading many news articles about the strange man or thing. They suddenly hear a noise behind them thus showing us the Batman in costume, fighting very originally. Danny Elfman's musical score in this scene just matches with what is going on. After a cool briefing with a news reporter and a corrupt cop named Eckhart we then get our first scene of Jack Napier/ The Joker played here by Jack Nicholson, I really think this was one of his most iconic roles in a film. Anyway, there's like a party at Bruce Wayne's mansion which shows us Michael Keaton acting as Bruce Wayne for the first time. I must admit that Keaton was the best man to fit into the bat suit but Christian Bale was the best Bruce Wayne for sure. Commissioner Gordon gets a tip from a rookie of reported sightings of Jack Napier searching the Axis Chemical factory for Harvey Dent's files. I was really hoping that Harvey Dent would become Two-Face in the film watching it for the first time but when I realized why The Joker was intentionally meant to be the only villain that thought vanished. After a conversation between the reporter from before and Viki Vale played by Kim Basinger with Bruce Wayne, Alfred shows up and tells Bruce about Commissioner Gordan's tip which calls for more BATMAN action. We then get the action scene in Axis Chemicals which might be one of my favorite moments in the film. It is here that Jack Napier falls into a vat of green chemicals which alters him into his new insane identity, THE JOKER. But I really did like him when he was just Jack Napier. Batman is thought to be the reason of why Jack fell in and the police nearly have him cornered but there's always a helpful gadget along with Batman. Meanwhile Jack Napier is at his trusted surgeon to fix his face, then discovering his smiley face in a mirror. What follows is a first menacing laugh of the films villain. A day later at night time, Bruce is having a wonderful time with Viki on a date. The Joker then goes to his boss's apartment and shoots him several times in a very creative fashion. Stuff happens until we get a delightful scene with the Joker on TV advertising his new deadly products which menace the society of Gotham. Batman tries to cope with the matter while still keeping up with Viki. The two were meant to meet at an art gallery but as 3 Hours pass Bruce still isn't there. The Joker enters the scene and knocks out everyone with some purple gas, Viki manages to stay alive from the air device Joker had gift wrapped for her previously. Before things get bad Batman crashes through the glass window above heroically to save the day, we then get a car chase with the bat-mobile. Excitement follows and the next day Viki discovers the truth about Bruce, his parents were killed when he was young. She then finds out that Bruce is BATMAN who now finds out that Joker was the killer of his parents and that he must now confront and kill him with great vengeance. A cool bat-plane scene follows and we reach the films' slow point being the end church fight. The Joker dies creatively and we get a nice finishing scene with Batman standing proud and tall on a respective building. Though I have just read the story as messily as I could, you should really watch this great film. I always wonder, do I like this more than Batman Begins or not. Even if I did it would be strong second favorite. The film was nicely done by Tim Burton. It is just an awesome film which I really recommend you watch. If you enjoyed you can view my further reviews or my previous ones, see you soon.

    First of all, let me start about telling Batman's roots. The Batman we know today is different than the one Bob Kane and Bill Finger created. The original Batman didn't hesitate killing his enemies. He was not the kind of Hero we see today, he was a vigilante/hero. Batman nowadays is a hero/hero. The reason for why they made Batman stop killing his enemies, is because there was period in the old comics where Batman used a gun to kill a monster (if I remember correctly, it was a monster created by Professor Hugo Strange). It sounds strange, but the fact remains that it was how Bob Kane and Bill Finger envisioned Batman. Well with this film Batman has gone back to his vigilante roots. He doesn't get bothered by the fact that he is killing the bad guys. Also his motivation of Batman is to get revenge for his parents, by punishing criminals in a bat-suit. Which was like the original Batman. Michael Keaton made a perfect Batman in this Batman, his mysterious, dark yet human looks could not have fit more as Batman. Jack Nicholson was... Astonishing!! Kim Basinger was a good Vicki Vale, beautiful, headstrong yet vulnerable. Tim Burton's Gothic style could not have fit more to the world inside Batman. Realistic, but not realistic realistic, comic realistic. If it was too realistic, then it would have been... Ehm, Wrong. To be perfectly honest, I prefer Burton's Batman, rather than Nolan's Batman. Why...? Well, I already wrote down the reasons. One of my favorite films and definitely my favorite Batman. 10/10

    In this movie, we see a man dressed as a bat fighting the Joker. What we don't have is Batman against the Joker. This vigilante, oddly dressed, KILLS WITHOUT EVEN THINKING, has no fighting or intelligence skills and is surrounded by a bunch of idiots: Alfred, his butler that doesn't care about his master's double identity, Vale, a journalist/photograph/nobodycares, an anonymous Gordon and a...very strange Harvey Dent. Good music and scenarios, Nicholson amazing in a role that wasn't too right, good Keaton. The story was wrote by monkeys...and Tim Burton. Trust me: if you want an amazing Batman movie go watch "The Dark Knight Trilogy"

Michael Keaton does have his moments in the cape and cowl that are cool (introduction scene), but really I think to care about what the man in the suit is doing you have to be invested in him without the suit as well, which they didn't do that great a job of in that aspect. Keaton's Bruce Wayne just feels so cold and distant, trying to be somewhat of an enigma yet also a bit psychotic which doesn't really allow to connect with him, and he doesn't really emote that much for you to feel pity. As far as the other character and actors of the movie, my feeling are a bit neutral. Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale probably isn't very necessary to the plot, and doesn't have much chemistry with Keaton (not surprising when you take into consideration that he ignores her for a big chink of it). The late Michael Gough was well cast as a more grandfatherly version of everyone's favorite butler Alfred, and I wish he had more to do in this. Robert Wuhl as the reporter Knox, really isn't that funny in the movie, which is a bit of a shame since he's a funny guy usually. Overall the cast, while not bad, was used half as much as they should have. The aesthetically, this is a very inspired movie, some of the Gotham city sets look spectacular it's very artsy in all of the gloomy tones you get from it, probably being Mr. Burton's best as far as production design is concerned. I'd be crazy not to mention Danny Elfman's score, which is definitely the best & most memorable part of the movie. The Batman Theme goes down as one of the greatest movie themes without a doubt, and am glad Elfman composed the opening to the wonderful Animated Series. When watching the film's technicalities, which may not come of as impressive today which is understandable, you can't help but be a little awestruck at some of the interesting visuals in it. As a huge Batman fan I can say while this is a heavily flawed movie, I can still be entertained by parts of it. If you didn't grow up with this version of Batman, you might be a little disappointed at some of the things you've come to love in lots of the various incarnations of Batman, but it can be an interesting one to watch. 7/10

    Hello fellow readers, welcome to another movie review, this time about my favorite Batman film of the franchise. Here it begins, if you enjoyed you can check out my review for Batman Returns (1992)So, the great film begins with a family lost in Gotham City which was designed very nicely in this film. They walk down in an eerie old alleyway only to be held up by some thugs. The film already gets exciting at this point for me. While atop a building, one of the thugs gets a weird feeling that the Batman is close by after reading many news articles about the strange man or thing. They suddenly hear a noise behind them thus showing us the Batman in costume, fighting very originally. Danny Elfman's musical score in this scene just matches with what is going on. After a cool briefing with a news reporter and a corrupt cop named Eckhart we then get our first scene of Jack Napier/ The Joker played here by Jack Nicholson, I really think this was one of his most iconic roles in a film. Anyway, there's like a party at Bruce Wayne's mansion which shows us Michael Keaton acting as Bruce Wayne for the first time. I must admit that Keaton was the best man to fit into the bat suit but Christian Bale was the best Bruce Wayne for sure. Commissioner Gordon gets a tip from a rookie of reported sightings of Jack Napier searching the Axis Chemical factory for Harvey Dent's files. I was really hoping that Harvey Dent would become Two-Face in the film watching it for the first time but when I realized why The Joker was intentionally meant to be the only villain that thought vanished. After a conversation between the reporter from before and Viki Vale played by Kim Basinger with Bruce Wayne, Alfred shows up and tells Bruce about Commissioner Gordan's tip which calls for more BATMAN action. We then get the action scene in Axis Chemicals which might be one of my favorite moments in the film. It is here that Jack Napier falls into a vat of green chemicals which alters him into his new insane identity, THE JOKER. But I really did like him when he was just Jack Napier. Batman is thought to be the reason of why Jack fell in and the police nearly have him cornered but there's always a helpful gadget along with Batman. Meanwhile Jack Napier is at his trusted surgeon to fix his face, then discovering his smiley face in a mirror. What follows is a first menacing laugh of the films villain. A day later at night time, Bruce is having a wonderful time with Viki on a date. The Joker then goes to his boss's apartment and shoots him several times in a very creative fashion. Stuff happens until we get a delightful scene with the Joker on TV advertising his new deadly products which menace the society of Gotham. Batman tries to cope with the matter while still keeping up with Viki. The two were meant to meet at an art gallery but as 3 Hours pass Bruce still isn't there. The Joker enters the scene and knocks out everyone with some purple gas, Viki manages to stay alive from the air device Joker had gift wrapped for her previously. Before things get bad Batman crashes through the glass window above heroically to save the day, we then get a car chase with the bat-mobile. Excitement follows and the next day Viki discovers the truth about Bruce, his parents were killed when he was young. She then finds out that Bruce is BATMAN who now finds out that Joker was the killer of his parents and that he must now confront and kill him with great vengeance. A cool bat-plane scene follows and we reach the films' slow point being the end church fight. The Joker dies creatively and we get a nice finishing scene with Batman standing proud and tall on a respective building. Though I have just read the story as messily as I could, you should really watch this great film. I always wonder, do I like this more than Batman Begins or not. Even if I did it would be strong second favorite. The film was nicely done by Tim Burton. It is just an awesome film which I really recommend you watch. If you enjoyed you can view my further reviews or my previous ones, see you soon.

    First of all, let me start about telling Batman's roots. The Batman we know today is different than the one Bob Kane and Bill Finger created. The original Batman didn't hesitate killing his enemies. He was not the kind of Hero we see today, he was a vigilante/hero. Batman nowadays is a hero/hero. The reason for why they made Batman stop killing his enemies, is because there was period in the old comics where Batman used a gun to kill a monster (if I remember correctly, it was a monster created by Professor Hugo Strange). It sounds strange, but the fact remains that it was how Bob Kane and Bill Finger envisioned Batman. Well with this film Batman has gone back to his vigilante roots. He doesn't get bothered by the fact that he is killing the bad guys. Also his motivation of Batman is to get revenge for his parents, by punishing criminals in a bat-suit. Which was like the original Batman. Michael Keaton made a perfect Batman in this Batman, his mysterious, dark yet human looks could not have fit more as Batman. Jack Nicholson was... Astonishing!! Kim Basinger was a good Vicki Vale, beautiful, headstrong yet vulnerable. Tim Burton's Gothic style could not have fit more to the world inside Batman. Realistic, but not realistic realistic, comic realistic. If it was too realistic, then it would have been... Ehm, Wrong. To be perfectly honest, I prefer Burton's Batman, rather than Nolan's Batman. Why...? Well, I already wrote down the reasons. One of my favorite films and definitely my favorite Batman. 10/10

    In this movie, we see a man dressed as a bat fighting the Joker. What we don't have is Batman against the Joker. This vigilante, oddly dressed, KILLS WITHOUT EVEN THINKING, has no fighting or intelligence skills and is surrounded by a bunch of idiots: Alfred, his butler that doesn't care about his master's double identity, Vale, a journalist/photograph/nobodycares, an anonymous Gordon and a...very strange Harvey Dent. Good music and scenarios, Nicholson amazing in a role that wasn't too right, good Keaton. The story was wrote by monkeys...and Tim Burton. Trust me: if you want an amazing Batman movie go watch "The Dark Knight Trilogy"

    In the late 1980's, producers were having trouble getting Batman on the big screen, luckily, dark visionist Tim Burton was there to give them a film that had great characters, great music, and a great look: All of these things were handled some of the best ever in cinematic history. Batman is refreshingly different from other superhero films, it keeps the character mysterious, and this suits his character perfectly. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the Joker: Loud, attention-craving, and hilarious. The cast is great, having a good love interest in Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale along with classic supporting actors like Robert Wuhl, Jack Palance, Tracey Walter, and Michael Gough. Danny Elfman's score is...in a word...incredible. Music is very important to storytelling and vice versa, the two things enhance each other immensely in this film. The production design perfectly sums up the realism of its characters and its own universe: It's fantastic, but not realistic, and it shouldn't be realistic, too many people forget the core concept is a man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime. The Batman series would go through many sequels and reboots of varying degrees of underrated and overrated, but none matched Batman, and most likely, none will. The closest we got, and close it is indeed, is its sequel Batman Returns.

    I must have been in the wrong mood to watch this film, a tired and mostly uninterested one, because I was extremely disappointed by it. Perhaps I wasn't keen because I'd seen and adored the Nolan trilogy so much, and thought that was the only way Batman should be done. Perhaps it was just too camp and over the top for me. Honestly, it could have been any of these, or a combination of them and various other things, but I just didn't enjoy this film very much. The film does work on a few levels, however, and it is these that I want to focus on, because there were some positive parts. Firstly, the film is pretty dark for its time, although nowhere near the levels of "The Dark Knight". The Joker's violence is pretty grim and stands out in a film which is made up of a lot of flair. The Joker's character itself is probably the best part of this film, and Jack Nicholson shines in the role. Having seen Heath Ledger's performance a number of times, I expected to be disappointed by Nicholson, but I felt completely the opposite. He added a completely different side to the Joker, going for violent sinister rather than psychological sinister, and I do think that they worked as well as each other. A lot of the action in the film is engaging and fun too, especially some of the Batman fight scenes. Now for the main problems in the film. Michael Keaton's take on the "Caped Crusader" was, to me, fairly uninteresting and felt like it had been completely masked by Nicholson's brilliance. I did enjoy Danny Elfman's score, and think that it was much better than Hans Zimmer attempts for the recent trilogy, but it was Prince's contribution which annoyed me the most. For a film which was trying to have at least a bit of seriousness among the dark comedy, the overly campy songs that filled the movie destroyed some of the darkness, being too lively and upbeat. The main problem in reviewing this film is that it has a remake which, for once, is far superior to the original, and now has such great renown that it's impossible to see one without comparing it to the other. I do wonder how I would have judged the film if I had never seen the "Dark Knight" trilogy, but I imagine my view would be fairly similar. And if this is supposed to be the best (or second best in some opinions) of the originals, I honestly fear how bad "Batman and Robin" must be.

    I remember back in 1989, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the pick of comedic actor Michael Keaton to play Bruce Wayne/Batman, and if director Tim Burton would turn this into a farce, as they had "Beetle Juice" the previous year, but those fears were unfounded, as Mr. Keaton was properly complex and brooding as Billionaire Bruce Wayne, whose secret identity of Batman enables him to clean up the corrupt streets of Gotham. His chief nemesis is Jack Napier/The Joker, who is the opposite of him; extrovert to his introvert, evil to his good, but there turns out to be a deeper connection than either man realizes until the end... Magnificent production, very detailed and Gothic take on Gotham, a mix of 1930's and 1980's styles. Fantastic action, and solid script make this a winner, even if the soundtrack by Prince is a bit incongruous to the setting. Otherwise, a triumph.

    The very first film in the franchise. I really loved the first Batman film. My experience was awesome. It kept me entertained the whole time. A great beginning. Nice and quick. The costuming was amazing. The acting was right on key, the direction and flow was awesome. And the music was just brilliant. It's everything you want to see in an action film. Trust me it's the bomb. This is the best Batman film out of all of the movies. Everything was great. The acting, the script, the special effects. Everything was a well done job. The filmmakers for once should be very proud of themselves. It was a great one. So everyone who's a fan of Bob Kane and Batman. They will not be disappointed. This film on DVD and Blu-ray will have you wanting to see all of the other Batman movies. Even though the rest of them aren't as good. So definitely a 10/10. Watch it and have a great time.

    As we all know, Tim Burton likes to use his imagination which is always out of the box. Batman is a good representation of the darker life of Batman. Not just the guy who everybody loves and adores. In this movie he is feared by everyone, not just the criminals. Micheal Keaton looks good in the bat suite, but as Bruce Wayne, not so much. He's voice as batman isn't really intimidating and a few cheesy lines doesn't quite fit the bill. Jack Nicholsen is the Joker, without any make up or movie magic he would still have looked like the joker! He's laugh is excellent and scary. He plays the role well and makes the movie what it is. Some parts of the movie could have been changed a bit. Like a bit more detail on how and why Bruce became batman? But at least the bat mobile and the bat wing looks cool. Batman uses his rappelling hook one to many times and that irritates me a lot. Overall it is a good representative of who the fearsome batman really is.

    THE GOOD: I rather like the 1989 Batman. Though realism pervades in the acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy, I prefer the Gothic expressionism of this earlier film. The look of Gotham hearkens back to Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), an oppressive city filled with pollution, oppression, and crime. In fact, the art direction is the best part of the whole film. I love how the ending is staged, obviously a throwback to Vertigo (1958). I love Danny Elfman's score, simultaneously heroic and twisted. THE MEH: Michael Keaton is both a good and bad Batman. His Bruce Wayne is excellent in that you would never expect him to be the Caped Crusader, and he does the whole brooding thing well. The problem is he physically does not fit the character. Also, his Bruce Wayne is a bit too Clark Kent-ish. THE UGLY: Kim Basinger gets stuck playing Vicky Vale, a character who exists only as an object for Batman and the Joker to brawl over. She's occasionally useful and at first serves as a stand-in for the audience as she learns more about the mysterious Bruce Wayne, but that role erodes over time and by the end she's just your garden variety damsel in distress whose every other line is a shrill scream. The script is atrocious. I understand the Joker's plan is intended to be chaotic, but the way the story is told is so clumsy. We don't know enough about the characters to care about them, especially Batman himself who gets little screen time in comparison to the Joker and Vicky. Perhaps they intended to make Batman more mysterious as a result, but there's a fine line between mysterious and vague, and they've crossed over that line. IN CONCLUSION: The atmosphere and art direction are great, but don't expect much depth in the way of story or character.

    Batman '89 from Tim Burton, is the movie that made Superhero movies the big deal of the year as far as theater attendance is concerned. It's marketing and merchandising sales thus created a great hype surrounding the movie's release, as people were excited to see a different take on Batman in the movies, since the cultural phenomenon was generally known to film and t.v audiences in the form of the Adam West Batman show in the 60's. Then when the movie came out in summer of '89 it went on to become the biggest domestic release of the year. So, 25 years later The Batman franchise's success has gone through many changes some great, some not, but to get to the heart of it you have to look at this one. Being that my favorite film incarnation of Batman is The Dark Knight Trilogy, I can't say that this movie had much of an impact on me as an already huge Batman fan, but I still really like certain parts of it. Jack Nicholson as The Joker is good, he really had the duty of carrying the movie as far as the performances go with a screen time of more than sixty minutes (half the movie's runtime), you start to realize that he's actually the main actor of the show. This is the movie's biggest plus yet also what I think to be it's biggest flaw, really because this is supposed to be a movie about Batman, but instead of choosing to develop him, they choose to develop the big baddie of the schlock.

Keaton's Bruce Wayne just feels so cold and distant, trying to be somewhat of an enigma yet also a bit psychotic which doesn't really allow to connect with him, and he doesn't really emote that much for you to feel pity.

Honestly, it could have been any of these, or a combination of them and various other things, but I just didn't enjoy this film very much. The film does work on a few levels, however, and it is these that I want to focus on, because there were some positive parts. Firstly, the film is pretty dark for its time, although nowhere near the levels of "The Dark Knight". The Joker's violence is pretty grim and stands out in a film which is made up of a lot of flair. The Joker's character itself is probably the best part of this film, and Jack Nicholson shines in the role. Having seen Heath Ledger's performance a number of times, I expected to be disappointed by Nicholson, but I felt completely the opposite. He added a completely different side to the Joker, going for violent sinister rather than psychological sinister, and I do think that they worked as well as each other. A lot of the action in the film is engaging and fun too, especially some of the Batman fight scenes. Now for the main problems in the film. Michael Keaton's take on the "Caped Crusader" was, to me, fairly uninteresting and felt like it had been completely masked by Nicholson's brilliance. I did enjoy Danny Elfman's score, and think that it was much better than Hans Zimmer attempts for the recent trilogy, but it was Prince's contribution which annoyed me the most. For a film which was trying to have at least a bit of seriousness among the dark comedy, the overly campy songs that filled the movie destroyed some of the darkness, being too lively and upbeat. The main problem in reviewing this film is that it has a remake which, for once, is far superior to the original, and now has such great renown that it's impossible to see one without comparing it to the other. I do wonder how I would have judged the film if I had never seen the "Dark Knight" trilogy, but I imagine my view would be fairly similar. And if this is supposed to be the best (or second best in some opinions) of the originals, I honestly fear how bad "Batman and Robin" must be.

    I remember back in 1989, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the pick of comedic actor Michael Keaton to play Bruce Wayne/Batman, and if director Tim Burton would turn this into a farce, as they had "Beetle Juice" the previous year, but those fears were unfounded, as Mr. Keaton was properly complex and brooding as Billionaire Bruce Wayne, whose secret identity of Batman enables him to clean up the corrupt streets of Gotham. His chief nemesis is Jack Napier/The Joker, who is the opposite of him; extrovert to his introvert, evil to his good, but there turns out to be a deeper connection than either man realizes until the end... Magnificent production, very detailed and Gothic take on Gotham, a mix of 1930's and 1980's styles. Fantastic action, and solid script make this a winner, even if the soundtrack by Prince is a bit incongruous to the setting. Otherwise, a triumph.

    The very first film in the franchise. I really loved the first Batman film. My experience was awesome. It kept me entertained the whole time. A great beginning. Nice and quick. The costuming was amazing. The acting was right on key, the direction and flow was awesome. And the music was just brilliant. It's everything you want to see in an action film. Trust me it's the bomb. This is the best Batman film out of all of the movies. Everything was great. The acting, the script, the special effects. Everything was a well done job. The filmmakers for once should be very proud of themselves. It was a great one. So everyone who's a fan of Bob Kane and Batman. They will not be disappointed. This film on DVD and Blu-ray will have you wanting to see all of the other Batman movies. Even though the rest of them aren't as good. So definitely a 10/10. Watch it and have a great time.

    As we all know, Tim Burton likes to use his imagination which is always out of the box. Batman is a good representation of the darker life of Batman. Not just the guy who everybody loves and adores. In this movie he is feared by everyone, not just the criminals. Micheal Keaton looks good in the bat suite, but as Bruce Wayne, not so much. He's voice as batman isn't really intimidating and a few cheesy lines doesn't quite fit the bill. Jack Nicholsen is the Joker, without any make up or movie magic he would still have looked like the joker! He's laugh is excellent and scary. He plays the role well and makes the movie what it is. Some parts of the movie could have been changed a bit. Like a bit more detail on how and why Bruce became batman? But at least the bat mobile and the bat wing looks cool. Batman uses his rappelling hook one to many times and that irritates me a lot. Overall it is a good representative of who the fearsome batman really is.

    THE GOOD: I rather like the 1989 Batman. Though realism pervades in the acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy, I prefer the Gothic expressionism of this earlier film. The look of Gotham hearkens back to Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), an oppressive city filled with pollution, oppression, and crime. In fact, the art direction is the best part of the whole film. I love how the ending is staged, obviously a throwback to Vertigo (1958). I love Danny Elfman's score, simultaneously heroic and twisted. THE MEH: Michael Keaton is both a good and bad Batman. His Bruce Wayne is excellent in that you would never expect him to be the Caped Crusader, and he does the whole brooding thing well. The problem is he physically does not fit the character. Also, his Bruce Wayne is a bit too Clark Kent-ish. THE UGLY: Kim Basinger gets stuck playing Vicky Vale, a character who exists only as an object for Batman and the Joker to brawl over. She's occasionally useful and at first serves as a stand-in for the audience as she learns more about the mysterious Bruce Wayne, but that role erodes over time and by the end she's just your garden variety damsel in distress whose every other line is a shrill scream. The script is atrocious. I understand the Joker's plan is intended to be chaotic, but the way the story is told is so clumsy. We don't know enough about the characters to care about them, especially Batman himself who gets little screen time in comparison to the Joker and Vicky. Perhaps they intended to make Batman more mysterious as a result, but there's a fine line between mysterious and vague, and they've crossed over that line. IN CONCLUSION: The atmosphere and art direction are great, but don't expect much depth in the way of story or character.

    Batman '89 from Tim Burton, is the movie that made Superhero movies the big deal of the year as far as theater attendance is concerned. It's marketing and merchandising sales thus created a great hype surrounding the movie's release, as people were excited to see a different take on Batman in the movies, since the cultural phenomenon was generally known to film and t.v audiences in the form of the Adam West Batman show in the 60's. Then when the movie came out in summer of '89 it went on to become the biggest domestic release of the year. So, 25 years later The Batman franchise's success has gone through many changes some great, some not, but to get to the heart of it you have to look at this one. Being that my favorite film incarnation of Batman is The Dark Knight Trilogy, I can't say that this movie had much of an impact on me as an already huge Batman fan, but I still really like certain parts of it. Jack Nicholson as The Joker is good, he really had the duty of carrying the movie as far as the performances go with a screen time of more than sixty minutes (half the movie's runtime), you start to realize that he's actually the main actor of the show. This is the movie's biggest plus yet also what I think to be it's biggest flaw, really because this is supposed to be a movie about Batman, but instead of choosing to develop him, they choose to develop the big baddie of the schlock. Michael Keaton does have his moments in the cape and cowl that are cool (introduction scene), but really I think to care about what the man in the suit is doing you have to be invested in him without the suit as well, which they didn't do that great a job of in that aspect. Keaton's Bruce Wayne just feels so cold and distant, trying to be somewhat of an enigma yet also a bit psychotic which doesn't really allow to connect with him, and he doesn't really emote that much for you to feel pity. As far as the other character and actors of the movie, my feeling are a bit neutral. Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale probably isn't very necessary to the plot, and doesn't have much chemistry with Keaton (not surprising when you take into consideration that he ignores her for a big chink of it). The late Michael Gough was well cast as a more grandfatherly version of everyone's favorite butler Alfred, and I wish he had more to do in this. Robert Wuhl as the reporter Knox, really isn't that funny in the movie, which is a bit of a shame since he's a funny guy usually. Overall the cast, while not bad, was used half as much as they should have. The aesthetically, this is a very inspired movie, some of the Gotham city sets look spectacular it's very artsy in all of the gloomy tones you get from it, probably being Mr. Burton's best as far as production design is concerned. I'd be crazy not to mention Danny Elfman's score, which is definitely the best & most memorable part of the movie. The Batman Theme goes down as one of the greatest movie themes without a doubt, and am glad Elfman composed the opening to the wonderful Animated Series. When watching the film's technicalities, which may not come of as impressive today which is understandable, you can't help but be a little awestruck at some of the interesting visuals in it. As a huge Batman fan I can say while this is a heavily flawed movie, I can still be entertained by parts of it. If you didn't grow up with this version of Batman, you might be a little disappointed at some of the things you've come to love in lots of the various incarnations of Batman, but it can be an interesting one to watch. 7/10

    Hello fellow readers, welcome to another movie review, this time about my favorite Batman film of the franchise. Here it begins, if you enjoyed you can check out my review for Batman Returns (1992)So, the great film begins with a family lost in Gotham City which was designed very nicely in this film. They walk down in an eerie old alleyway only to be held up by some thugs. The film already gets exciting at this point for me. While atop a building, one of the thugs gets a weird feeling that the Batman is close by after reading many news articles about the strange man or thing. They suddenly hear a noise behind them thus showing us the Batman in costume, fighting very originally. Danny Elfman's musical score in this scene just matches with what is going on. After a cool briefing with a news reporter and a corrupt cop named Eckhart we then get our first scene of Jack Napier/ The Joker played here by Jack Nicholson, I really think this was one of his most iconic roles in a film. Anyway, there's like a party at Bruce Wayne's mansion which shows us Michael Keaton acting as Bruce Wayne for the first time. I must admit that Keaton was the best man to fit into the bat suit but Christian Bale was the best Bruce Wayne for sure. Commissioner Gordon gets a tip from a rookie of reported sightings of Jack Napier searching the Axis Chemical factory for Harvey Dent's files. I was really hoping that Harvey Dent would become Two-Face in the film watching it for the first time but when I realized why The Joker was intentionally meant to be the only villain that thought vanished. After a conversation between the reporter from before and Viki Vale played by Kim Basinger with Bruce Wayne, Alfred shows up and tells Bruce about Commissioner Gordan's tip which calls for more BATMAN action. We then get the action scene in Axis Chemicals which might be one of my favorite moments in the film. It is here that Jack Napier falls into a vat of green chemicals which alters him into his new insane identity, THE JOKER. But I really did like him when he was just Jack Napier. Batman is thought to be the reason of why Jack fell in and the police nearly have him cornered but there's always a helpful gadget along with Batman. Meanwhile Jack Napier is at his trusted surgeon to fix his face, then discovering his smiley face in a mirror. What follows is a first menacing laugh of the films villain. A day later at night time, Bruce is having a wonderful time with Viki on a date. The Joker then goes to his boss's apartment and shoots him several times in a very creative fashion. Stuff happens until we get a delightful scene with the Joker on TV advertising his new deadly products which menace the society of Gotham. Batman tries to cope with the matter while still keeping up with Viki. The two were meant to meet at an art gallery but as 3 Hours pass Bruce still isn't there. The Joker enters the scene and knocks out everyone with some purple gas, Viki manages to stay alive from the air device Joker had gift wrapped for her previously. Before things get bad Batman crashes through the glass window above heroically to save the day, we then get a car chase with the bat-mobile. Excitement follows and the next day Viki discovers the truth about Bruce, his parents were killed when he was young. She then finds out that Bruce is BATMAN who now finds out that Joker was the killer of his parents and that he must now confront and kill him with great vengeance. A cool bat-plane scene follows and we reach the films' slow point being the end church fight. The Joker dies creatively and we get a nice finishing scene with Batman standing proud and tall on a respective building. Though I have just read the story as messily as I could, you should really watch this great film. I always wonder, do I like this more than Batman Begins or not. Even if I did it would be strong second favorite. The film was nicely done by Tim Burton. It is just an awesome film which I really recommend you watch. If you enjoyed you can view my further reviews or my previous ones, see you soon.

    First of all, let me start about telling Batman's roots. The Batman we know today is different than the one Bob Kane and Bill Finger created. The original Batman didn't hesitate killing his enemies. He was not the kind of Hero we see today, he was a vigilante/hero. Batman nowadays is a hero/hero. The reason for why they made Batman stop killing his enemies, is because there was period in the old comics where Batman used a gun to kill a monster (if I remember correctly, it was a monster created by Professor Hugo Strange). It sounds strange, but the fact remains that it was how Bob Kane and Bill Finger envisioned Batman. Well with this film Batman has gone back to his vigilante roots. He doesn't get bothered by the fact that he is killing the bad guys. Also his motivation of Batman is to get revenge for his parents, by punishing criminals in a bat-suit. Which was like the original Batman. Michael Keaton made a perfect Batman in this Batman, his mysterious, dark yet human looks could not have fit more as Batman. Jack Nicholson was... Astonishing!! Kim Basinger was a good Vicki Vale, beautiful, headstrong yet vulnerable. Tim Burton's Gothic style could not have fit more to the world inside Batman. Realistic, but not realistic realistic, comic realistic. If it was too realistic, then it would have been... Ehm, Wrong. To be perfectly honest, I prefer Burton's Batman, rather than Nolan's Batman. Why...? Well, I already wrote down the reasons. One of my favorite films and definitely my favorite Batman. 10/10

    In this movie, we see a man dressed as a bat fighting the Joker. What we don't have is Batman against the Joker. This vigilante, oddly dressed, KILLS WITHOUT EVEN THINKING, has no fighting or intelligence skills and is surrounded by a bunch of idiots: Alfred, his butler that doesn't care about his master's double identity, Vale, a journalist/photograph/nobodycares, an anonymous Gordon and a...very strange Harvey Dent. Good music and scenarios, Nicholson amazing in a role that wasn't too right, good Keaton. The story was wrote by monkeys...and Tim Burton. Trust me: if you want an amazing Batman movie go watch "The Dark Knight Trilogy"

    In the late 1980's, producers were having trouble getting Batman on the big screen, luckily, dark visionist Tim Burton was there to give them a film that had great characters, great music, and a great look: All of these things were handled some of the best ever in cinematic history. Batman is refreshingly different from other superhero films, it keeps the character mysterious, and this suits his character perfectly. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the Joker: Loud, attention-craving, and hilarious. The cast is great, having a good love interest in Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale along with classic supporting actors like Robert Wuhl, Jack Palance, Tracey Walter, and Michael Gough. Danny Elfman's score is...in a word...incredible. Music is very important to storytelling and vice versa, the two things enhance each other immensely in this film. The production design perfectly sums up the realism of its characters and its own universe: It's fantastic, but not realistic, and it shouldn't be realistic, too many people forget the core concept is a man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime. The Batman series would go through many sequels and reboots of varying degrees of underrated and overrated, but none matched Batman, and most likely, none will. The closest we got, and close it is indeed, is its sequel Batman Returns.

If you didn't grow up with this version of Batman, you might be a little disappointed at some of the things you've come to love in lots of the various incarnations of Batman, but it can be an interesting one to watch. 7/10

    Hello fellow readers, welcome to another movie review, this time about my favorite Batman film of the franchise. Here it begins, if you enjoyed you can check out my review for Batman Returns (1992)So, the great film begins with a family lost in Gotham City which was designed very nicely in this film. They walk down in an eerie old alleyway only to be held up by some thugs. The film already gets exciting at this point for me. While atop a building, one of the thugs gets a weird feeling that the Batman is close by after reading many news articles about the strange man or thing. They suddenly hear a noise behind them thus showing us the Batman in costume, fighting very originally. Danny Elfman's musical score in this scene just matches with what is going on. After a cool briefing with a news reporter and a corrupt cop named Eckhart we then get our first scene of Jack Napier/ The Joker played here by Jack Nicholson, I really think this was one of his most iconic roles in a film. Anyway, there's like a party at Bruce Wayne's mansion which shows us Michael Keaton acting as Bruce Wayne for the first time. I must admit that Keaton was the best man to fit into the bat suit but Christian Bale was the best Bruce Wayne for sure. Commissioner Gordon gets a tip from a rookie of reported sightings of Jack Napier searching the Axis Chemical factory for Harvey Dent's files. I was really hoping that Harvey Dent would become Two-Face in the film watching it for the first time but when I realized why The Joker was intentionally meant to be the only villain that thought vanished. After a conversation between the reporter from before and Viki Vale played by Kim Basinger with Bruce Wayne, Alfred shows up and tells Bruce about Commissioner Gordan's tip which calls for more BATMAN action. We then get the action scene in Axis Chemicals which might be one of my favorite moments in the film. It is here that Jack Napier falls into a vat of green chemicals which alters him into his new insane identity, THE JOKER. But I really did like him when he was just Jack Napier. Batman is thought to be the reason of why Jack fell in and the police nearly have him cornered but there's always a helpful gadget along with Batman. Meanwhile Jack Napier is at his trusted surgeon to fix his face, then discovering his smiley face in a mirror. What follows is a first menacing laugh of the films villain. A day later at night time, Bruce is having a wonderful time with Viki on a date. The Joker then goes to his boss's apartment and shoots him several times in a very creative fashion. Stuff happens until we get a delightful scene with the Joker on TV advertising his new deadly products which menace the society of Gotham. Batman tries to cope with the matter while still keeping up with Viki. The two were meant to meet at an art gallery but as 3 Hours pass Bruce still isn't there. The Joker enters the scene and knocks out everyone with some purple gas, Viki manages to stay alive from the air device Joker had gift wrapped for her previously. Before things get bad Batman crashes through the glass window above heroically to save the day, we then get a car chase with the bat-mobile. Excitement follows and the next day Viki discovers the truth about Bruce, his parents were killed when he was young. She then finds out that Bruce is BATMAN who now finds out that Joker was the killer of his parents and that he must now confront and kill him with great vengeance. A cool bat-plane scene follows and we reach the films' slow point being the end church fight. The Joker dies creatively and we get a nice finishing scene with Batman standing proud and tall on a respective building. Though I have just read the story as messily as I could, you should really watch this great film. I always wonder, do I like this more than Batman Begins or not. Even if I did it would be strong second favorite. The film was nicely done by Tim Burton. It is just an awesome film which I really recommend you watch. If you enjoyed you can view my further reviews or my previous ones, see you soon.

    First of all, let me start about telling Batman's roots. The Batman we know today is different than the one Bob Kane and Bill Finger created. The original Batman didn't hesitate killing his enemies. He was not the kind of Hero we see today, he was a vigilante/hero. Batman nowadays is a hero/hero. The reason for why they made Batman stop killing his enemies, is because there was period in the old comics where Batman used a gun to kill a monster (if I remember correctly, it was a monster created by Professor Hugo Strange). It sounds strange, but the fact remains that it was how Bob Kane and Bill Finger envisioned Batman. Well with this film Batman has gone back to his vigilante roots. He doesn't get bothered by the fact that he is killing the bad guys. Also his motivation of Batman is to get revenge for his parents, by punishing criminals in a bat-suit. Which was like the original Batman. Michael Keaton made a perfect Batman in this Batman, his mysterious, dark yet human looks could not have fit more as Batman. Jack Nicholson was... Astonishing!! Kim Basinger was a good Vicki Vale, beautiful, headstrong yet vulnerable. Tim Burton's Gothic style could not have fit more to the world inside Batman. Realistic, but not realistic realistic, comic realistic. If it was too realistic, then it would have been... Ehm, Wrong. To be perfectly honest, I prefer Burton's Batman, rather than Nolan's Batman. Why...? Well, I already wrote down the reasons. One of my favorite films and definitely my favorite Batman. 10/10

    In this movie, we see a man dressed as a bat fighting the Joker. What we don't have is Batman against the Joker. This vigilante, oddly dressed, KILLS WITHOUT EVEN THINKING, has no fighting or intelligence skills and is surrounded by a bunch of idiots: Alfred, his butler that doesn't care about his master's double identity, Vale, a journalist/photograph/nobodycares, an anonymous Gordon and a...very strange Harvey Dent. Good music and scenarios, Nicholson amazing in a role that wasn't too right, good Keaton. The story was wrote by monkeys...and Tim Burton. Trust me: if you want an amazing Batman movie go watch "The Dark Knight Trilogy"

    In the late 1980's, producers were having trouble getting Batman on the big screen, luckily, dark visionist Tim Burton was there to give them a film that had great characters, great music, and a great look: All of these things were handled some of the best ever in cinematic history. Batman is refreshingly different from other superhero films, it keeps the character mysterious, and this suits his character perfectly. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the Joker: Loud, attention-craving, and hilarious. The cast is great, having a good love interest in Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale along with classic supporting actors like Robert Wuhl, Jack Palance, Tracey Walter, and Michael Gough. Danny Elfman's score is...in a word...incredible. Music is very important to storytelling and vice versa, the two things enhance each other immensely in this film. The production design perfectly sums up the realism of its characters and its own universe: It's fantastic, but not realistic, and it shouldn't be realistic, too many people forget the core concept is a man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime. The Batman series would go through many sequels and reboots of varying degrees of underrated and overrated, but none matched Batman, and most likely, none will. The closest we got, and close it is indeed, is its sequel Batman Returns.

    I must have been in the wrong mood to watch this film, a tired and mostly uninterested one, because I was extremely disappointed by it. Perhaps I wasn't keen because I'd seen and adored the Nolan trilogy so much, and thought that was the only way Batman should be done. Perhaps it was just too camp and over the top for me. Honestly, it could have been any of these, or a combination of them and various other things, but I just didn't enjoy this film very much. The film does work on a few levels, however, and it is these that I want to focus on, because there were some positive parts. Firstly, the film is pretty dark for its time, although nowhere near the levels of "The Dark Knight". The Joker's violence is pretty grim and stands out in a film which is made up of a lot of flair. The Joker's character itself is probably the best part of this film, and Jack Nicholson shines in the role. Having seen Heath Ledger's performance a number of times, I expected to be disappointed by Nicholson, but I felt completely the opposite. He added a completely different side to the Joker, going for violent sinister rather than psychological sinister, and I do think that they worked as well as each other. A lot of the action in the film is engaging and fun too, especially some of the Batman fight scenes. Now for the main problems in the film. Michael Keaton's take on the "Caped Crusader" was, to me, fairly uninteresting and felt like it had been completely masked by Nicholson's brilliance. I did enjoy Danny Elfman's score, and think that it was much better than Hans Zimmer attempts for the recent trilogy, but it was Prince's contribution which annoyed me the most. For a film which was trying to have at least a bit of seriousness among the dark comedy, the overly campy songs that filled the movie destroyed some of the darkness, being too lively and upbeat. The main problem in reviewing this film is that it has a remake which, for once, is far superior to the original, and now has such great renown that it's impossible to see one without comparing it to the other. I do wonder how I would have judged the film if I had never seen the "Dark Knight" trilogy, but I imagine my view would be fairly similar. And if this is supposed to be the best (or second best in some opinions) of the originals, I honestly fear how bad "Batman and Robin" must be.

    I remember back in 1989, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the pick of comedic actor Michael Keaton to play Bruce Wayne/Batman, and if director Tim Burton would turn this into a farce, as they had "Beetle Juice" the previous year, but those fears were unfounded, as Mr. Keaton was properly complex and brooding as Billionaire Bruce Wayne, whose secret identity of Batman enables him to clean up the corrupt streets of Gotham. His chief nemesis is Jack Napier/The Joker, who is the opposite of him; extrovert to his introvert, evil to his good, but there turns out to be a deeper connection than either man realizes until the end... Magnificent production, very detailed and Gothic take on Gotham, a mix of 1930's and 1980's styles. Fantastic action, and solid script make this a winner, even if the soundtrack by Prince is a bit incongruous to the setting. Otherwise, a triumph.

    The very first film in the franchise. I really loved the first Batman film. My experience was awesome. It kept me entertained the whole time. A great beginning. Nice and quick. The costuming was amazing. The acting was right on key, the direction and flow was awesome. And the music was just brilliant. It's everything you want to see in an action film. Trust me it's the bomb. This is the best Batman film out of all of the movies. Everything was great. The acting, the script, the special effects. Everything was a well done job. The filmmakers for once should be very proud of themselves. It was a great one. So everyone who's a fan of Bob Kane and Batman. They will not be disappointed. This film on DVD and Blu-ray will have you wanting to see all of the other Batman movies. Even though the rest of them aren't as good. So definitely a 10/10. Watch it and have a great time.

    As we all know, Tim Burton likes to use his imagination which is always out of the box. Batman is a good representation of the darker life of Batman. Not just the guy who everybody loves and adores. In this movie he is feared by everyone, not just the criminals. Micheal Keaton looks good in the bat suite, but as Bruce Wayne, not so much. He's voice as batman isn't really intimidating and a few cheesy lines doesn't quite fit the bill. Jack Nicholsen is the Joker, without any make up or movie magic he would still have looked like the joker! He's laugh is excellent and scary. He plays the role well and makes the movie what it is. Some parts of the movie could have been changed a bit. Like a bit more detail on how and why Bruce became batman? But at least the bat mobile and the bat wing looks cool. Batman uses his rappelling hook one to many times and that irritates me a lot. Overall it is a good representative of who the fearsome batman really is.

    THE GOOD: I rather like the 1989 Batman. Though realism pervades in the acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy, I prefer the Gothic expressionism of this earlier film. The look of Gotham hearkens back to Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), an oppressive city filled with pollution, oppression, and crime. In fact, the art direction is the best part of the whole film. I love how the ending is staged, obviously a throwback to Vertigo (1958). I love Danny Elfman's score, simultaneously heroic and twisted. THE MEH: Michael Keaton is both a good and bad Batman. His Bruce Wayne is excellent in that you would never expect him to be the Caped Crusader, and he does the whole brooding thing well. The problem is he physically does not fit the character. Also, his Bruce Wayne is a bit too Clark Kent-ish. THE UGLY: Kim Basinger gets stuck playing Vicky Vale, a character who exists only as an object for Batman and the Joker to brawl over. She's occasionally useful and at first serves as a stand-in for the audience as she learns more about the mysterious Bruce Wayne, but that role erodes over time and by the end she's just your garden variety damsel in distress whose every other line is a shrill scream. The script is atrocious. I understand the Joker's plan is intended to be chaotic, but the way the story is told is so clumsy. We don't know enough about the characters to care about them, especially Batman himself who gets little screen time in comparison to the Joker and Vicky. Perhaps they intended to make Batman more mysterious as a result, but there's a fine line between mysterious and vague, and they've crossed over that line. IN CONCLUSION: The atmosphere and art direction are great, but don't expect much depth in the way of story or character.
