 <sinopse>
  "Rambo" parody in which Topper Harley leads a rescue team into Iraq to save Iraqi war prisoners and all of their previous rescue teams.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Topper Harley is found working as an odd-job-man in a monastery. The CIA wants him to lead a rescue mission into Iraq, to rescue the last rescue team, who went in to rescue the last rescue team who... who went in to rescue hostages left behind after Desert Storm. The President is Tug Benson, who also likes to be in on the action. Basically, it's a send-up of all the big shoot-em-up Rambo/Robocop/T2/Commando-type movies.

    While not as good as Hot Shots this is still a pretty funny parody. Charlie Sheen is back as Topper Harley and so are some of the other actors from the first one. Sheen is extremely buff for this movie. Why do actors buff up and then let it slide? After so much work to get there I would try to at least keep some of it. Rowan Atkinson is his typical understated self as one of the rescued prisoners. Lloyd Bridges reprises his role as the goofy admiral with great elan. Valeria Golino is back as Ramada but she goes from a shrink to a rag head guide. The guy who plays Sadam Hussein is unreal in his look alike role. The end of the fight scene between Bridges and Hussein is pretty good and the reconstitution when Hussein becomes part namby-pamby dog is good. Brenda Bakke is good as the turned security adviser who does all she can to destroy the rescue mission. The vault from the head board is awesome. Of course I assume (I know) it was done by a stunt person.

    "Hot Shots! Part Deux" beats the odds to be pretty good, not just as spoofs go, but as spoof *sequels* go. Granted, it's not always very funny, but enough of the verbal and visual jokes work to make this solidly entertaining comedy fare, and a worthy sequel to the hilarious first movie. It goes about making fun of the corpse littered action escapism films of the 1980s, which of course were a genre just ripe for parody. Charlie Sheen returns as hero Topper Harley, now living in Thailand after getting his heart broken by Ramada (Valeria Golino). He's approached by the CIA to undertake a top secret mission in the Middle East where he must rescue the rescue team who went in to save the rescue team who tried to retrieve some hostages. Also returning from the first film are Lloyd Bridges, who once again is an absolute riot; somehow, his idiotic character Thomas "Tug" Benson has become the President of the United States. Jerry Haleva makes an encore appearance as Saddam Hussein, and gets more to do this time, including a climactic duel with Benson. New characters include those played by lovely Brenda Bakke, Richard Crenna (who gets to poke fun at his own "Rambo" series role), Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Mitch Ryan, Ryan Stiles, Gregory Sierra, Andreas Katsulas, and Clyde Kusatsu. So there's a lot of familiar faces here, including some other famous faces in gag cameos. (The best one is by Sheen's dad Martin.) One of the brightest jokes is the "bloodiest movie ever" one; among the movies and shows parodied are "Basic Instinct", "No Way Out", "Lady and the Tramp", "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", and Bridges' own series 'Sea Hunt', but mostly co-writer and director Jim Abrahams, an old hand at this sort of thing, keeps his focus on skewering the mindless macho action flick. Overall, this is a very enjoyable comedy, no matter if some of the humour is dated (such as referring to then first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton). It manages to hold up pretty well on repeat viewings. And war is indeed fantastic. Eight out of 10.

    Hot Shots Part Deux is a better than average movie with a alright story line and a great cast.Its definitely not better than the original Hot Shots,but its not an awful sequel.People who where fans of the first might be disappointed,but I didn't have very high hopes because I wasn't a huge fan of the first,but its definitely not as good as the first,I just found it to be a movie to just laugh at,but still misses a lot,its not as good as movies like Airplane or The Naked Gun.Fans of the first Hot Shots will probably be disappointed,but will probably still laugh at many scenes. Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) returns,this time in a parody of Rambo as he is the leader of a team in heading to Iraq to rescue a soldier who has been kidnapped.

    The first "Hot Shots", whilst not exactly bowling the critics over, remains a popular addition to the spoof genre. But despite having seen the original many times, the sequel had largely passed me by. I guess I wasn't that bothered by it - how many spoof sequels can you think of that match the original - but thankfully, I shouldn't have been that worried. By switching its focus from mocking "Top Gun" to the likes of "Rambo", "Robocop" and "Commando", the film retains its delightfully silly outlook on things but still goes for the jugular against a soft target. Rock God from Mars Charlie Sheen returns as Topper Harley who has now left the military and is living a simpler life in a Tibetan monastery after having his heart broken by his former squeeze Ramada (Valeria Golino). But Topper is soon back in action after President Tug Benson (Lloyd Bridges) sends Colonel Walters (Richard Crenna) and CIA agent Michelle Huddlestone (Brenda Bakke) to get Topper leading a rescue mission in Iraq to free the guys who were sent to free the guys who were sent to free hostages from the first Gulf War. But as before, there is a saboteur in the side and soon, Topper must seriously rack up the body count in order to get the job done. "Hot Shots: Part Deux" is not a film to take seriously - this is as stupid a film as I can recall. Like the first, it crams every scene with sight gags, one liners and slapstick and also like the first, a fair number do raise a smile if few out-and-out laughs. It isn't anything like as funny as its spiritual predecessors like "Airplane!" or "The Naked Gun", despite the director being one of the three responsible for them. However, it is funnier than modern spoofs like "Scary Movie" or "Meet The Spartans" but to be frank, I find the BBC News channel funnier than those films. Sheen is surprisingly funny as Topper, aping Sly Stallone perfectly despite launching a chicken from a longbow with intent, and so is Crenna who is basically playing his "Rambo" character for laughs instead. The rest of the cast do OK, mainly following Bridges lead but he does provide another link to the earlier, better movies. It's as if the film makers were pleading for legitimacy, saying that this is a proper spoof even if there is no Leslie Nielsen in it. I understand that "Rambo"-style films aren't exactly hard to spoof but "Hot Shots: Part Deux" does a decent job of bringing them down a peg or two. It isn't a laugh-a-minute mickey-take but it does make you smile and remind you how utterly stupid most action movies from that era actually are. Even compared to the first "Hot Shots!", it holds up pretty well but I couldn't escape the sense that they were trying a bit too hard. What made the likes of "Airplane!" so special was the screenplay which was simply hilarious on its own. There was no need for special effects besides the crude aeroplane model being buffeted by lightning - the lines and performances were enough. Here, the gags are almost drowned out by the explosions and fire fights - each scene simply takes its cue from scenes in other films but replays them for laughs. Nothing wrong with that, as such, but I just preferred the earlier spoofs to these ones. And remember, it's been a long time since spoof movies enjoyed this level of success.

    If you are the hardcore movie fan, particularly comedy fan, this movie rocks! Everything is over the top, but only for a very big laugh from the audiences. I saw this movie after a long time of Charlie Sheen's big bad news. However, he had a great look of the main actor even in comedy movie. Lloyd Bridges also showed his outstanding performance as the poker face comedian. He made me think of the late Leslie Nielsen. Oh god! the United States has the Rambo president! Every gag that we see in this movie are non-sense, silly, and flawlessly laughing matter. However, I love this and I will grant that Hot Shots! Part Deux is one of the greatest comedy movie in all time!

    Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) has retired from the Navy and become a Buddhist in a small village. Colonel Walters (Richard Crenna) and Michelle Huddleston (Brenda Bakke), CIA, arrive and try to persuade Topper to come out of retirement in order to rescue a rescue party who went in to rescue a rescue party who are now hostages in Iraq. There is plenty of debate on the internet about who is hotter: Brenda Bakke or Valeria Golino. What a silly question -- Golino without a doubt! (I cannot say Golino is hot overall, I have not seen most of her work. But here she is gorgeous, and of course she was in "Big Top Pee-Wee" alongside her fianc&eacute;e Benicio De Toto.) Maybe this film is silly and has no plot... but I like it, and it gets better the more I am familiar with the films it spoofs. Charlie Sheen is winning in this film. Pure winning.

    I watched "Part Deux" just a day after the original and found it just a couple of notches below its predecessor. The spoof target is mainly "Rambo-First Blood", but as before many other films are referenced, like "Basic Instinct", "Apocalypse Now" (naturally) "Robin Hood Prince of Thieves" and even Disney's "The Lady and the Tramp". it's all part of the fun, of course, as well as making sure you watch the background, where a sight-gag is invariably playing. Charlie Sheen is all pumped up with somewhere to go, although this time I found too much camera time devoted to Lloyd Bridges' president, even if he does seem to anticipate Dubya years in advance. There are some comic gems, like the "Geronimo" sketch, heck I even laughed out loud at the map showing a no-man's land between Iraq and A Hard Place. If that kind of humour tickles you, there's plenty more, for better or worse, from where that came from, although the first in the series, where the characters and situations were fresher, in my opinion, edges out its follow-up in the comedy stakes.

    Jim Abrahams ran out of "Top Gun" jokes, so this sequel mainly focuses on the even more spoof-worthy "Rambo"-movies. Apart from that, it's pretty much the same as the first. And honestly, what could anyone have against that? This stuff is just hilarious in all its weirdness, I wouldn't want it any other way. Also Charlie Sheen still fits in so surprisingly well and Valeria Golino returns too because well, pretty girls with foreign accents make any movie better. Highlights include the inevitable breakings of the fourth wall, the "Apocalypse Now" spoof that comes from pretty much nowhere and the downright bizarre running gag with the birth mark. I also enjoyed pretty much every sequence featuring Saddam, because it just felt so delightfully wrong. This movie is exactly what you expect, which I guess is a good thing.

    Following up the "Top Gun" parody with a "Rambo" parody, Pat Proft and Jim Abrams score a perfect 10 again. Starring Charlie Sheen, Lloyd Bridges, Valeria Golino, Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Bob Vila, and many more, this comedy nails its genre. Don't worry about the plot, just watch everything on screen a few times because you're still missing stuff. If you're old, you'll laugh at the name of the character Richard Crenna plays (Col. Denton Walters). Golino was Ramada Thompson in "Hot Shots!," but here she's Ramada Rodham Hayman. The other female characters include Michelle Rodham Huddleston, Lavinia Rodham Benson, and Mrs. Rodham Soto. This is a hilarious comedy that competent adults will appreciate.

    I don't know if I've ever seen a comedy as zany or as randomly silly as "Hot Shots! Part Deux." Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first "Hot Shots!" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds. Like its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of "Top Gun" but made references to dozens of other movies from "Dances With Wolves" to "Gone with the Wind." Likewise, the sequel is a parody of "Rambo III", but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in "Rambo III", Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country. Now this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of "Rambo III", but I spotted parodies of "Casablanca", "Platoon" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), "Lady and the Tramp", "The Wizard of Oz", "Terminator 2" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody "Star Wars", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is "The Behn Gazaarah" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say "Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!" "Hot Shots! Part Deux" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of "Casablanca." It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner. And if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first "Hot Shots!" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas "Tug" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience. In closing, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.

The spoof target is mainly "Rambo-First Blood", but as before many other films are referenced, like "Basic Instinct", "Apocalypse Now" (naturally) "Robin Hood Prince of Thieves" and even Disney's "The Lady and the Tramp". it's all part of the fun, of course, as well as making sure you watch the background, where a sight-gag is invariably playing. Charlie Sheen is all pumped up with somewhere to go, although this time I found too much camera time devoted to Lloyd Bridges' president, even if he does seem to anticipate Dubya years in advance. There are some comic gems, like the "Geronimo" sketch, heck I even laughed out loud at the map showing a no-man's land between Iraq and A Hard Place. If that kind of humour tickles you, there's plenty more, for better or worse, from where that came from, although the first in the series, where the characters and situations were fresher, in my opinion, edges out its follow-up in the comedy stakes.

    Jim Abrahams ran out of "Top Gun" jokes, so this sequel mainly focuses on the even more spoof-worthy "Rambo"-movies. Apart from that, it's pretty much the same as the first. And honestly, what could anyone have against that? This stuff is just hilarious in all its weirdness, I wouldn't want it any other way. Also Charlie Sheen still fits in so surprisingly well and Valeria Golino returns too because well, pretty girls with foreign accents make any movie better. Highlights include the inevitable breakings of the fourth wall, the "Apocalypse Now" spoof that comes from pretty much nowhere and the downright bizarre running gag with the birth mark. I also enjoyed pretty much every sequence featuring Saddam, because it just felt so delightfully wrong. This movie is exactly what you expect, which I guess is a good thing.

    Following up the "Top Gun" parody with a "Rambo" parody, Pat Proft and Jim Abrams score a perfect 10 again. Starring Charlie Sheen, Lloyd Bridges, Valeria Golino, Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Bob Vila, and many more, this comedy nails its genre. Don't worry about the plot, just watch everything on screen a few times because you're still missing stuff. If you're old, you'll laugh at the name of the character Richard Crenna plays (Col. Denton Walters). Golino was Ramada Thompson in "Hot Shots!," but here she's Ramada Rodham Hayman. The other female characters include Michelle Rodham Huddleston, Lavinia Rodham Benson, and Mrs. Rodham Soto. This is a hilarious comedy that competent adults will appreciate.

    I don't know if I've ever seen a comedy as zany or as randomly silly as "Hot Shots! Part Deux." Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first "Hot Shots!" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds. Like its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of "Top Gun" but made references to dozens of other movies from "Dances With Wolves" to "Gone with the Wind." Likewise, the sequel is a parody of "Rambo III", but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in "Rambo III", Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country. Now this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of "Rambo III", but I spotted parodies of "Casablanca", "Platoon" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), "Lady and the Tramp", "The Wizard of Oz", "Terminator 2" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody "Star Wars", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is "The Behn Gazaarah" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say "Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!" "Hot Shots! Part Deux" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of "Casablanca." It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner. And if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first "Hot Shots!" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas "Tug" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience. In closing, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.

    While not as good as Hot Shots this is still a pretty funny parody. Charlie Sheen is back as Topper Harley and so are some of the other actors from the first one. Sheen is extremely buff for this movie. Why do actors buff up and then let it slide? After so much work to get there I would try to at least keep some of it. Rowan Atkinson is his typical understated self as one of the rescued prisoners. Lloyd Bridges reprises his role as the goofy admiral with great elan. Valeria Golino is back as Ramada but she goes from a shrink to a rag head guide. The guy who plays Sadam Hussein is unreal in his look alike role. The end of the fight scene between Bridges and Hussein is pretty good and the reconstitution when Hussein becomes part namby-pamby dog is good. Brenda Bakke is good as the turned security adviser who does all she can to destroy the rescue mission. The vault from the head board is awesome. Of course I assume (I know) it was done by a stunt person.

    "Hot Shots! Part Deux" beats the odds to be pretty good, not just as spoofs go, but as spoof *sequels* go. Granted, it's not always very funny, but enough of the verbal and visual jokes work to make this solidly entertaining comedy fare, and a worthy sequel to the hilarious first movie. It goes about making fun of the corpse littered action escapism films of the 1980s, which of course were a genre just ripe for parody. Charlie Sheen returns as hero Topper Harley, now living in Thailand after getting his heart broken by Ramada (Valeria Golino). He's approached by the CIA to undertake a top secret mission in the Middle East where he must rescue the rescue team who went in to save the rescue team who tried to retrieve some hostages. Also returning from the first film are Lloyd Bridges, who once again is an absolute riot; somehow, his idiotic character Thomas "Tug" Benson has become the President of the United States. Jerry Haleva makes an encore appearance as Saddam Hussein, and gets more to do this time, including a climactic duel with Benson. New characters include those played by lovely Brenda Bakke, Richard Crenna (who gets to poke fun at his own "Rambo" series role), Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Mitch Ryan, Ryan Stiles, Gregory Sierra, Andreas Katsulas, and Clyde Kusatsu. So there's a lot of familiar faces here, including some other famous faces in gag cameos. (The best one is by Sheen's dad Martin.) One of the brightest jokes is the "bloodiest movie ever" one; among the movies and shows parodied are "Basic Instinct", "No Way Out", "Lady and the Tramp", "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", and Bridges' own series 'Sea Hunt', but mostly co-writer and director Jim Abrahams, an old hand at this sort of thing, keeps his focus on skewering the mindless macho action flick. Overall, this is a very enjoyable comedy, no matter if some of the humour is dated (such as referring to then first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton). It manages to hold up pretty well on repeat viewings. And war is indeed fantastic. Eight out of 10.

    Hot Shots Part Deux is a better than average movie with a alright story line and a great cast.Its definitely not better than the original Hot Shots,but its not an awful sequel.People who where fans of the first might be disappointed,but I didn't have very high hopes because I wasn't a huge fan of the first,but its definitely not as good as the first,I just found it to be a movie to just laugh at,but still misses a lot,its not as good as movies like Airplane or The Naked Gun.Fans of the first Hot Shots will probably be disappointed,but will probably still laugh at many scenes. Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) returns,this time in a parody of Rambo as he is the leader of a team in heading to Iraq to rescue a soldier who has been kidnapped.

    The first "Hot Shots", whilst not exactly bowling the critics over, remains a popular addition to the spoof genre. But despite having seen the original many times, the sequel had largely passed me by. I guess I wasn't that bothered by it - how many spoof sequels can you think of that match the original - but thankfully, I shouldn't have been that worried. By switching its focus from mocking "Top Gun" to the likes of "Rambo", "Robocop" and "Commando", the film retains its delightfully silly outlook on things but still goes for the jugular against a soft target. Rock God from Mars Charlie Sheen returns as Topper Harley who has now left the military and is living a simpler life in a Tibetan monastery after having his heart broken by his former squeeze Ramada (Valeria Golino). But Topper is soon back in action after President Tug Benson (Lloyd Bridges) sends Colonel Walters (Richard Crenna) and CIA agent Michelle Huddlestone (Brenda Bakke) to get Topper leading a rescue mission in Iraq to free the guys who were sent to free the guys who were sent to free hostages from the first Gulf War. But as before, there is a saboteur in the side and soon, Topper must seriously rack up the body count in order to get the job done. "Hot Shots: Part Deux" is not a film to take seriously - this is as stupid a film as I can recall. Like the first, it crams every scene with sight gags, one liners and slapstick and also like the first, a fair number do raise a smile if few out-and-out laughs. It isn't anything like as funny as its spiritual predecessors like "Airplane!" or "The Naked Gun", despite the director being one of the three responsible for them. However, it is funnier than modern spoofs like "Scary Movie" or "Meet The Spartans" but to be frank, I find the BBC News channel funnier than those films. Sheen is surprisingly funny as Topper, aping Sly Stallone perfectly despite launching a chicken from a longbow with intent, and so is Crenna who is basically playing his "Rambo" character for laughs instead. The rest of the cast do OK, mainly following Bridges lead but he does provide another link to the earlier, better movies. It's as if the film makers were pleading for legitimacy, saying that this is a proper spoof even if there is no Leslie Nielsen in it. I understand that "Rambo"-style films aren't exactly hard to spoof but "Hot Shots: Part Deux" does a decent job of bringing them down a peg or two. It isn't a laugh-a-minute mickey-take but it does make you smile and remind you how utterly stupid most action movies from that era actually are. Even compared to the first "Hot Shots!", it holds up pretty well but I couldn't escape the sense that they were trying a bit too hard. What made the likes of "Airplane!" so special was the screenplay which was simply hilarious on its own. There was no need for special effects besides the crude aeroplane model being buffeted by lightning - the lines and performances were enough. Here, the gags are almost drowned out by the explosions and fire fights - each scene simply takes its cue from scenes in other films but replays them for laughs. Nothing wrong with that, as such, but I just preferred the earlier spoofs to these ones. And remember, it's been a long time since spoof movies enjoyed this level of success.

    If you are the hardcore movie fan, particularly comedy fan, this movie rocks! Everything is over the top, but only for a very big laugh from the audiences. I saw this movie after a long time of Charlie Sheen's big bad news. However, he had a great look of the main actor even in comedy movie. Lloyd Bridges also showed his outstanding performance as the poker face comedian. He made me think of the late Leslie Nielsen. Oh god! the United States has the Rambo president! Every gag that we see in this movie are non-sense, silly, and flawlessly laughing matter. However, I love this and I will grant that Hot Shots! Part Deux is one of the greatest comedy movie in all time!

    Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) has retired from the Navy and become a Buddhist in a small village. Colonel Walters (Richard Crenna) and Michelle Huddleston (Brenda Bakke), CIA, arrive and try to persuade Topper to come out of retirement in order to rescue a rescue party who went in to rescue a rescue party who are now hostages in Iraq. There is plenty of debate on the internet about who is hotter: Brenda Bakke or Valeria Golino. What a silly question -- Golino without a doubt! (I cannot say Golino is hot overall, I have not seen most of her work. But here she is gorgeous, and of course she was in "Big Top Pee-Wee" alongside her fianc&eacute;e Benicio De Toto.) Maybe this film is silly and has no plot... but I like it, and it gets better the more I am familiar with the films it spoofs. Charlie Sheen is winning in this film. Pure winning.

I guess I wasn't that bothered by it - how many spoof sequels can you think of that match the original - but thankfully, I shouldn't have been that worried. By switching its focus from mocking "Top Gun" to the likes of "Rambo", "Robocop" and "Commando", the film retains its delightfully silly outlook on things but still goes for the jugular against a soft target. Rock God from Mars Charlie Sheen returns as Topper Harley who has now left the military and is living a simpler life in a Tibetan monastery after having his heart broken by his former squeeze Ramada (Valeria Golino). But Topper is soon back in action after President Tug Benson (Lloyd Bridges) sends Colonel Walters (Richard Crenna) and CIA agent Michelle Huddlestone (Brenda Bakke) to get Topper leading a rescue mission in Iraq to free the guys who were sent to free the guys who were sent to free hostages from the first Gulf War. But as before, there is a saboteur in the side and soon, Topper must seriously rack up the body count in order to get the job done. "Hot Shots: Part Deux" is not a film to take seriously - this is as stupid a film as I can recall. Like the first, it crams every scene with sight gags, one liners and slapstick and also like the first, a fair number do raise a smile if few out-and-out laughs. It isn't anything like as funny as its spiritual predecessors like "Airplane!" or "The Naked Gun", despite the director being one of the three responsible for them. However, it is funnier than modern spoofs like "Scary Movie" or "Meet The Spartans" but to be frank, I find the BBC News channel funnier than those films. Sheen is surprisingly funny as Topper, aping Sly Stallone perfectly despite launching a chicken from a longbow with intent, and so is Crenna who is basically playing his "Rambo" character for laughs instead. The rest of the cast do OK, mainly following Bridges lead but he does provide another link to the earlier, better movies. It's as if the film makers were pleading for legitimacy, saying that this is a proper spoof even if there is no Leslie Nielsen in it. I understand that "Rambo"-style films aren't exactly hard to spoof but "Hot Shots: Part Deux" does a decent job of bringing them down a peg or two. It isn't a laugh-a-minute mickey-take but it does make you smile and remind you how utterly stupid most action movies from that era actually are. Even compared to the first "Hot Shots!", it holds up pretty well but I couldn't escape the sense that they were trying a bit too hard. What made the likes of "Airplane!" so special was the screenplay which was simply hilarious on its own. There was no need for special effects besides the crude aeroplane model being buffeted by lightning - the lines and performances were enough. Here, the gags are almost drowned out by the explosions and fire fights - each scene simply takes its cue from scenes in other films but replays them for laughs. Nothing wrong with that, as such, but I just preferred the earlier spoofs to these ones. And remember, it's been a long time since spoof movies enjoyed this level of success.

    If you are the hardcore movie fan, particularly comedy fan, this movie rocks! Everything is over the top, but only for a very big laugh from the audiences. I saw this movie after a long time of Charlie Sheen's big bad news. However, he had a great look of the main actor even in comedy movie. Lloyd Bridges also showed his outstanding performance as the poker face comedian. He made me think of the late Leslie Nielsen. Oh god! the United States has the Rambo president! Every gag that we see in this movie are non-sense, silly, and flawlessly laughing matter. However, I love this and I will grant that Hot Shots! Part Deux is one of the greatest comedy movie in all time!

    Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) has retired from the Navy and become a Buddhist in a small village. Colonel Walters (Richard Crenna) and Michelle Huddleston (Brenda Bakke), CIA, arrive and try to persuade Topper to come out of retirement in order to rescue a rescue party who went in to rescue a rescue party who are now hostages in Iraq. There is plenty of debate on the internet about who is hotter: Brenda Bakke or Valeria Golino. What a silly question -- Golino without a doubt! (I cannot say Golino is hot overall, I have not seen most of her work. But here she is gorgeous, and of course she was in "Big Top Pee-Wee" alongside her fianc&eacute;e Benicio De Toto.) Maybe this film is silly and has no plot... but I like it, and it gets better the more I am familiar with the films it spoofs. Charlie Sheen is winning in this film. Pure winning.

    I watched "Part Deux" just a day after the original and found it just a couple of notches below its predecessor. The spoof target is mainly "Rambo-First Blood", but as before many other films are referenced, like "Basic Instinct", "Apocalypse Now" (naturally) "Robin Hood Prince of Thieves" and even Disney's "The Lady and the Tramp". it's all part of the fun, of course, as well as making sure you watch the background, where a sight-gag is invariably playing. Charlie Sheen is all pumped up with somewhere to go, although this time I found too much camera time devoted to Lloyd Bridges' president, even if he does seem to anticipate Dubya years in advance. There are some comic gems, like the "Geronimo" sketch, heck I even laughed out loud at the map showing a no-man's land between Iraq and A Hard Place. If that kind of humour tickles you, there's plenty more, for better or worse, from where that came from, although the first in the series, where the characters and situations were fresher, in my opinion, edges out its follow-up in the comedy stakes.

    Jim Abrahams ran out of "Top Gun" jokes, so this sequel mainly focuses on the even more spoof-worthy "Rambo"-movies. Apart from that, it's pretty much the same as the first. And honestly, what could anyone have against that? This stuff is just hilarious in all its weirdness, I wouldn't want it any other way. Also Charlie Sheen still fits in so surprisingly well and Valeria Golino returns too because well, pretty girls with foreign accents make any movie better. Highlights include the inevitable breakings of the fourth wall, the "Apocalypse Now" spoof that comes from pretty much nowhere and the downright bizarre running gag with the birth mark. I also enjoyed pretty much every sequence featuring Saddam, because it just felt so delightfully wrong. This movie is exactly what you expect, which I guess is a good thing.

    Following up the "Top Gun" parody with a "Rambo" parody, Pat Proft and Jim Abrams score a perfect 10 again. Starring Charlie Sheen, Lloyd Bridges, Valeria Golino, Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Bob Vila, and many more, this comedy nails its genre. Don't worry about the plot, just watch everything on screen a few times because you're still missing stuff. If you're old, you'll laugh at the name of the character Richard Crenna plays (Col. Denton Walters). Golino was Ramada Thompson in "Hot Shots!," but here she's Ramada Rodham Hayman. The other female characters include Michelle Rodham Huddleston, Lavinia Rodham Benson, and Mrs. Rodham Soto. This is a hilarious comedy that competent adults will appreciate.

    I don't know if I've ever seen a comedy as zany or as randomly silly as "Hot Shots! Part Deux." Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first "Hot Shots!" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds. Like its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of "Top Gun" but made references to dozens of other movies from "Dances With Wolves" to "Gone with the Wind." Likewise, the sequel is a parody of "Rambo III", but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in "Rambo III", Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country. Now this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of "Rambo III", but I spotted parodies of "Casablanca", "Platoon" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), "Lady and the Tramp", "The Wizard of Oz", "Terminator 2" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody "Star Wars", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is "The Behn Gazaarah" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say "Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!" "Hot Shots! Part Deux" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of "Casablanca." It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner. And if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first "Hot Shots!" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas "Tug" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience. In closing, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.

    While not as good as Hot Shots this is still a pretty funny parody. Charlie Sheen is back as Topper Harley and so are some of the other actors from the first one. Sheen is extremely buff for this movie. Why do actors buff up and then let it slide? After so much work to get there I would try to at least keep some of it. Rowan Atkinson is his typical understated self as one of the rescued prisoners. Lloyd Bridges reprises his role as the goofy admiral with great elan. Valeria Golino is back as Ramada but she goes from a shrink to a rag head guide. The guy who plays Sadam Hussein is unreal in his look alike role. The end of the fight scene between Bridges and Hussein is pretty good and the reconstitution when Hussein becomes part namby-pamby dog is good. Brenda Bakke is good as the turned security adviser who does all she can to destroy the rescue mission. The vault from the head board is awesome. Of course I assume (I know) it was done by a stunt person.

    "Hot Shots! Part Deux" beats the odds to be pretty good, not just as spoofs go, but as spoof *sequels* go. Granted, it's not always very funny, but enough of the verbal and visual jokes work to make this solidly entertaining comedy fare, and a worthy sequel to the hilarious first movie. It goes about making fun of the corpse littered action escapism films of the 1980s, which of course were a genre just ripe for parody. Charlie Sheen returns as hero Topper Harley, now living in Thailand after getting his heart broken by Ramada (Valeria Golino). He's approached by the CIA to undertake a top secret mission in the Middle East where he must rescue the rescue team who went in to save the rescue team who tried to retrieve some hostages. Also returning from the first film are Lloyd Bridges, who once again is an absolute riot; somehow, his idiotic character Thomas "Tug" Benson has become the President of the United States. Jerry Haleva makes an encore appearance as Saddam Hussein, and gets more to do this time, including a climactic duel with Benson. New characters include those played by lovely Brenda Bakke, Richard Crenna (who gets to poke fun at his own "Rambo" series role), Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Mitch Ryan, Ryan Stiles, Gregory Sierra, Andreas Katsulas, and Clyde Kusatsu. So there's a lot of familiar faces here, including some other famous faces in gag cameos. (The best one is by Sheen's dad Martin.) One of the brightest jokes is the "bloodiest movie ever" one; among the movies and shows parodied are "Basic Instinct", "No Way Out", "Lady and the Tramp", "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", and Bridges' own series 'Sea Hunt', but mostly co-writer and director Jim Abrahams, an old hand at this sort of thing, keeps his focus on skewering the mindless macho action flick. Overall, this is a very enjoyable comedy, no matter if some of the humour is dated (such as referring to then first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton). It manages to hold up pretty well on repeat viewings. And war is indeed fantastic. Eight out of 10.

    Hot Shots Part Deux is a better than average movie with a alright story line and a great cast.Its definitely not better than the original Hot Shots,but its not an awful sequel.People who where fans of the first might be disappointed,but I didn't have very high hopes because I wasn't a huge fan of the first,but its definitely not as good as the first,I just found it to be a movie to just laugh at,but still misses a lot,its not as good as movies like Airplane or The Naked Gun.Fans of the first Hot Shots will probably be disappointed,but will probably still laugh at many scenes. Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) returns,this time in a parody of Rambo as he is the leader of a team in heading to Iraq to rescue a soldier who has been kidnapped.

    I don't know if I've ever seen a comedy as zany or as randomly silly as "Hot Shots! Part Deux." Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first "Hot Shots!" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds. Like its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of "Top Gun" but made references to dozens of other movies from "Dances With Wolves" to "Gone with the Wind." Likewise, the sequel is a parody of "Rambo III", but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in "Rambo III", Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country. Now this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of "Rambo III", but I spotted parodies of "Casablanca", "Platoon" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), "Lady and the Tramp", "The Wizard of Oz", "Terminator 2" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody "Star Wars", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is "The Behn Gazaarah" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say "Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!" "Hot Shots! Part Deux" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of "Casablanca." It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner. And if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first "Hot Shots!" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas "Tug" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience. In closing, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.

    While not as good as Hot Shots this is still a pretty funny parody. Charlie Sheen is back as Topper Harley and so are some of the other actors from the first one. Sheen is extremely buff for this movie. Why do actors buff up and then let it slide? After so much work to get there I would try to at least keep some of it. Rowan Atkinson is his typical understated self as one of the rescued prisoners. Lloyd Bridges reprises his role as the goofy admiral with great elan. Valeria Golino is back as Ramada but she goes from a shrink to a rag head guide. The guy who plays Sadam Hussein is unreal in his look alike role. The end of the fight scene between Bridges and Hussein is pretty good and the reconstitution when Hussein becomes part namby-pamby dog is good. Brenda Bakke is good as the turned security adviser who does all she can to destroy the rescue mission. The vault from the head board is awesome. Of course I assume (I know) it was done by a stunt person.

    "Hot Shots! Part Deux" beats the odds to be pretty good, not just as spoofs go, but as spoof *sequels* go. Granted, it's not always very funny, but enough of the verbal and visual jokes work to make this solidly entertaining comedy fare, and a worthy sequel to the hilarious first movie. It goes about making fun of the corpse littered action escapism films of the 1980s, which of course were a genre just ripe for parody. Charlie Sheen returns as hero Topper Harley, now living in Thailand after getting his heart broken by Ramada (Valeria Golino). He's approached by the CIA to undertake a top secret mission in the Middle East where he must rescue the rescue team who went in to save the rescue team who tried to retrieve some hostages. Also returning from the first film are Lloyd Bridges, who once again is an absolute riot; somehow, his idiotic character Thomas "Tug" Benson has become the President of the United States. Jerry Haleva makes an encore appearance as Saddam Hussein, and gets more to do this time, including a climactic duel with Benson. New characters include those played by lovely Brenda Bakke, Richard Crenna (who gets to poke fun at his own "Rambo" series role), Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Mitch Ryan, Ryan Stiles, Gregory Sierra, Andreas Katsulas, and Clyde Kusatsu. So there's a lot of familiar faces here, including some other famous faces in gag cameos. (The best one is by Sheen's dad Martin.) One of the brightest jokes is the "bloodiest movie ever" one; among the movies and shows parodied are "Basic Instinct", "No Way Out", "Lady and the Tramp", "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", and Bridges' own series 'Sea Hunt', but mostly co-writer and director Jim Abrahams, an old hand at this sort of thing, keeps his focus on skewering the mindless macho action flick. Overall, this is a very enjoyable comedy, no matter if some of the humour is dated (such as referring to then first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton). It manages to hold up pretty well on repeat viewings. And war is indeed fantastic. Eight out of 10.

    Hot Shots Part Deux is a better than average movie with a alright story line and a great cast.Its definitely not better than the original Hot Shots,but its not an awful sequel.People who where fans of the first might be disappointed,but I didn't have very high hopes because I wasn't a huge fan of the first,but its definitely not as good as the first,I just found it to be a movie to just laugh at,but still misses a lot,its not as good as movies like Airplane or The Naked Gun.Fans of the first Hot Shots will probably be disappointed,but will probably still laugh at many scenes. Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) returns,this time in a parody of Rambo as he is the leader of a team in heading to Iraq to rescue a soldier who has been kidnapped.

    The first "Hot Shots", whilst not exactly bowling the critics over, remains a popular addition to the spoof genre. But despite having seen the original many times, the sequel had largely passed me by. I guess I wasn't that bothered by it - how many spoof sequels can you think of that match the original - but thankfully, I shouldn't have been that worried. By switching its focus from mocking "Top Gun" to the likes of "Rambo", "Robocop" and "Commando", the film retains its delightfully silly outlook on things but still goes for the jugular against a soft target. Rock God from Mars Charlie Sheen returns as Topper Harley who has now left the military and is living a simpler life in a Tibetan monastery after having his heart broken by his former squeeze Ramada (Valeria Golino). But Topper is soon back in action after President Tug Benson (Lloyd Bridges) sends Colonel Walters (Richard Crenna) and CIA agent Michelle Huddlestone (Brenda Bakke) to get Topper leading a rescue mission in Iraq to free the guys who were sent to free the guys who were sent to free hostages from the first Gulf War. But as before, there is a saboteur in the side and soon, Topper must seriously rack up the body count in order to get the job done. "Hot Shots: Part Deux" is not a film to take seriously - this is as stupid a film as I can recall. Like the first, it crams every scene with sight gags, one liners and slapstick and also like the first, a fair number do raise a smile if few out-and-out laughs. It isn't anything like as funny as its spiritual predecessors like "Airplane!" or "The Naked Gun", despite the director being one of the three responsible for them. However, it is funnier than modern spoofs like "Scary Movie" or "Meet The Spartans" but to be frank, I find the BBC News channel funnier than those films. Sheen is surprisingly funny as Topper, aping Sly Stallone perfectly despite launching a chicken from a longbow with intent, and so is Crenna who is basically playing his "Rambo" character for laughs instead. The rest of the cast do OK, mainly following Bridges lead but he does provide another link to the earlier, better movies. It's as if the film makers were pleading for legitimacy, saying that this is a proper spoof even if there is no Leslie Nielsen in it. I understand that "Rambo"-style films aren't exactly hard to spoof but "Hot Shots: Part Deux" does a decent job of bringing them down a peg or two. It isn't a laugh-a-minute mickey-take but it does make you smile and remind you how utterly stupid most action movies from that era actually are. Even compared to the first "Hot Shots!", it holds up pretty well but I couldn't escape the sense that they were trying a bit too hard. What made the likes of "Airplane!" so special was the screenplay which was simply hilarious on its own. There was no need for special effects besides the crude aeroplane model being buffeted by lightning - the lines and performances were enough. Here, the gags are almost drowned out by the explosions and fire fights - each scene simply takes its cue from scenes in other films but replays them for laughs. Nothing wrong with that, as such, but I just preferred the earlier spoofs to these ones. And remember, it's been a long time since spoof movies enjoyed this level of success.

    If you are the hardcore movie fan, particularly comedy fan, this movie rocks! Everything is over the top, but only for a very big laugh from the audiences. I saw this movie after a long time of Charlie Sheen's big bad news. However, he had a great look of the main actor even in comedy movie. Lloyd Bridges also showed his outstanding performance as the poker face comedian. He made me think of the late Leslie Nielsen. Oh god! the United States has the Rambo president! Every gag that we see in this movie are non-sense, silly, and flawlessly laughing matter. However, I love this and I will grant that Hot Shots! Part Deux is one of the greatest comedy movie in all time!

    Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) has retired from the Navy and become a Buddhist in a small village. Colonel Walters (Richard Crenna) and Michelle Huddleston (Brenda Bakke), CIA, arrive and try to persuade Topper to come out of retirement in order to rescue a rescue party who went in to rescue a rescue party who are now hostages in Iraq. There is plenty of debate on the internet about who is hotter: Brenda Bakke or Valeria Golino. What a silly question -- Golino without a doubt! (I cannot say Golino is hot overall, I have not seen most of her work. But here she is gorgeous, and of course she was in "Big Top Pee-Wee" alongside her fianc&eacute;e Benicio De Toto.) Maybe this film is silly and has no plot... but I like it, and it gets better the more I am familiar with the films it spoofs. Charlie Sheen is winning in this film. Pure winning.

    I watched "Part Deux" just a day after the original and found it just a couple of notches below its predecessor. The spoof target is mainly "Rambo-First Blood", but as before many other films are referenced, like "Basic Instinct", "Apocalypse Now" (naturally) "Robin Hood Prince of Thieves" and even Disney's "The Lady and the Tramp". it's all part of the fun, of course, as well as making sure you watch the background, where a sight-gag is invariably playing. Charlie Sheen is all pumped up with somewhere to go, although this time I found too much camera time devoted to Lloyd Bridges' president, even if he does seem to anticipate Dubya years in advance. There are some comic gems, like the "Geronimo" sketch, heck I even laughed out loud at the map showing a no-man's land between Iraq and A Hard Place. If that kind of humour tickles you, there's plenty more, for better or worse, from where that came from, although the first in the series, where the characters and situations were fresher, in my opinion, edges out its follow-up in the comedy stakes.

    Jim Abrahams ran out of "Top Gun" jokes, so this sequel mainly focuses on the even more spoof-worthy "Rambo"-movies. Apart from that, it's pretty much the same as the first. And honestly, what could anyone have against that? This stuff is just hilarious in all its weirdness, I wouldn't want it any other way. Also Charlie Sheen still fits in so surprisingly well and Valeria Golino returns too because well, pretty girls with foreign accents make any movie better. Highlights include the inevitable breakings of the fourth wall, the "Apocalypse Now" spoof that comes from pretty much nowhere and the downright bizarre running gag with the birth mark. I also enjoyed pretty much every sequence featuring Saddam, because it just felt so delightfully wrong. This movie is exactly what you expect, which I guess is a good thing.

    Following up the "Top Gun" parody with a "Rambo" parody, Pat Proft and Jim Abrams score a perfect 10 again. Starring Charlie Sheen, Lloyd Bridges, Valeria Golino, Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Bob Vila, and many more, this comedy nails its genre. Don't worry about the plot, just watch everything on screen a few times because you're still missing stuff. If you're old, you'll laugh at the name of the character Richard Crenna plays (Col. Denton Walters). Golino was Ramada Thompson in "Hot Shots!," but here she's Ramada Rodham Hayman. The other female characters include Michelle Rodham Huddleston, Lavinia Rodham Benson, and Mrs. Rodham Soto. This is a hilarious comedy that competent adults will appreciate.

    I don't know if I've ever seen a comedy as zany or as randomly silly as "Hot Shots! Part Deux." Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first "Hot Shots!" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds. Like its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of "Top Gun" but made references to dozens of other movies from "Dances With Wolves" to "Gone with the Wind." Likewise, the sequel is a parody of "Rambo III", but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in "Rambo III", Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country. Now this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of "Rambo III", but I spotted parodies of "Casablanca", "Platoon" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), "Lady and the Tramp", "The Wizard of Oz", "Terminator 2" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody "Star Wars", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is "The Behn Gazaarah" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say "Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!" "Hot Shots! Part Deux" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of "Casablanca." It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner. And if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first "Hot Shots!" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas "Tug" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience. In closing, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.

I also enjoyed pretty much every sequence featuring Saddam, because it just felt so delightfully wrong. This movie is exactly what you expect, which I guess is a good thing.

    Following up the "Top Gun" parody with a "Rambo" parody, Pat Proft and Jim Abrams score a perfect 10 again. Starring Charlie Sheen, Lloyd Bridges, Valeria Golino, Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Bob Vila, and many more, this comedy nails its genre. Don't worry about the plot, just watch everything on screen a few times because you're still missing stuff. If you're old, you'll laugh at the name of the character Richard Crenna plays (Col. Denton Walters). Golino was Ramada Thompson in "Hot Shots!," but here she's Ramada Rodham Hayman. The other female characters include Michelle Rodham Huddleston, Lavinia Rodham Benson, and Mrs. Rodham Soto. This is a hilarious comedy that competent adults will appreciate.

    I don't know if I've ever seen a comedy as zany or as randomly silly as "Hot Shots! Part Deux." Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first "Hot Shots!" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds. Like its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of "Top Gun" but made references to dozens of other movies from "Dances With Wolves" to "Gone with the Wind." Likewise, the sequel is a parody of "Rambo III", but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in "Rambo III", Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country. Now this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of "Rambo III", but I spotted parodies of "Casablanca", "Platoon" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), "Lady and the Tramp", "The Wizard of Oz", "Terminator 2" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody "Star Wars", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is "The Behn Gazaarah" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say "Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!" "Hot Shots! Part Deux" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of "Casablanca." It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner. And if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first "Hot Shots!" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas "Tug" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience. In closing, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.

    While not as good as Hot Shots this is still a pretty funny parody. Charlie Sheen is back as Topper Harley and so are some of the other actors from the first one. Sheen is extremely buff for this movie. Why do actors buff up and then let it slide? After so much work to get there I would try to at least keep some of it. Rowan Atkinson is his typical understated self as one of the rescued prisoners. Lloyd Bridges reprises his role as the goofy admiral with great elan. Valeria Golino is back as Ramada but she goes from a shrink to a rag head guide. The guy who plays Sadam Hussein is unreal in his look alike role. The end of the fight scene between Bridges and Hussein is pretty good and the reconstitution when Hussein becomes part namby-pamby dog is good. Brenda Bakke is good as the turned security adviser who does all she can to destroy the rescue mission. The vault from the head board is awesome. Of course I assume (I know) it was done by a stunt person.

    "Hot Shots! Part Deux" beats the odds to be pretty good, not just as spoofs go, but as spoof *sequels* go. Granted, it's not always very funny, but enough of the verbal and visual jokes work to make this solidly entertaining comedy fare, and a worthy sequel to the hilarious first movie. It goes about making fun of the corpse littered action escapism films of the 1980s, which of course were a genre just ripe for parody. Charlie Sheen returns as hero Topper Harley, now living in Thailand after getting his heart broken by Ramada (Valeria Golino). He's approached by the CIA to undertake a top secret mission in the Middle East where he must rescue the rescue team who went in to save the rescue team who tried to retrieve some hostages. Also returning from the first film are Lloyd Bridges, who once again is an absolute riot; somehow, his idiotic character Thomas "Tug" Benson has become the President of the United States. Jerry Haleva makes an encore appearance as Saddam Hussein, and gets more to do this time, including a climactic duel with Benson. New characters include those played by lovely Brenda Bakke, Richard Crenna (who gets to poke fun at his own "Rambo" series role), Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Mitch Ryan, Ryan Stiles, Gregory Sierra, Andreas Katsulas, and Clyde Kusatsu. So there's a lot of familiar faces here, including some other famous faces in gag cameos. (The best one is by Sheen's dad Martin.) One of the brightest jokes is the "bloodiest movie ever" one; among the movies and shows parodied are "Basic Instinct", "No Way Out", "Lady and the Tramp", "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", and Bridges' own series 'Sea Hunt', but mostly co-writer and director Jim Abrahams, an old hand at this sort of thing, keeps his focus on skewering the mindless macho action flick. Overall, this is a very enjoyable comedy, no matter if some of the humour is dated (such as referring to then first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton). It manages to hold up pretty well on repeat viewings. And war is indeed fantastic. Eight out of 10.

    Hot Shots Part Deux is a better than average movie with a alright story line and a great cast.Its definitely not better than the original Hot Shots,but its not an awful sequel.People who where fans of the first might be disappointed,but I didn't have very high hopes because I wasn't a huge fan of the first,but its definitely not as good as the first,I just found it to be a movie to just laugh at,but still misses a lot,its not as good as movies like Airplane or The Naked Gun.Fans of the first Hot Shots will probably be disappointed,but will probably still laugh at many scenes. Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) returns,this time in a parody of Rambo as he is the leader of a team in heading to Iraq to rescue a soldier who has been kidnapped.

    The first "Hot Shots", whilst not exactly bowling the critics over, remains a popular addition to the spoof genre. But despite having seen the original many times, the sequel had largely passed me by. I guess I wasn't that bothered by it - how many spoof sequels can you think of that match the original - but thankfully, I shouldn't have been that worried. By switching its focus from mocking "Top Gun" to the likes of "Rambo", "Robocop" and "Commando", the film retains its delightfully silly outlook on things but still goes for the jugular against a soft target. Rock God from Mars Charlie Sheen returns as Topper Harley who has now left the military and is living a simpler life in a Tibetan monastery after having his heart broken by his former squeeze Ramada (Valeria Golino). But Topper is soon back in action after President Tug Benson (Lloyd Bridges) sends Colonel Walters (Richard Crenna) and CIA agent Michelle Huddlestone (Brenda Bakke) to get Topper leading a rescue mission in Iraq to free the guys who were sent to free the guys who were sent to free hostages from the first Gulf War. But as before, there is a saboteur in the side and soon, Topper must seriously rack up the body count in order to get the job done. "Hot Shots: Part Deux" is not a film to take seriously - this is as stupid a film as I can recall. Like the first, it crams every scene with sight gags, one liners and slapstick and also like the first, a fair number do raise a smile if few out-and-out laughs. It isn't anything like as funny as its spiritual predecessors like "Airplane!" or "The Naked Gun", despite the director being one of the three responsible for them. However, it is funnier than modern spoofs like "Scary Movie" or "Meet The Spartans" but to be frank, I find the BBC News channel funnier than those films. Sheen is surprisingly funny as Topper, aping Sly Stallone perfectly despite launching a chicken from a longbow with intent, and so is Crenna who is basically playing his "Rambo" character for laughs instead. The rest of the cast do OK, mainly following Bridges lead but he does provide another link to the earlier, better movies. It's as if the film makers were pleading for legitimacy, saying that this is a proper spoof even if there is no Leslie Nielsen in it. I understand that "Rambo"-style films aren't exactly hard to spoof but "Hot Shots: Part Deux" does a decent job of bringing them down a peg or two. It isn't a laugh-a-minute mickey-take but it does make you smile and remind you how utterly stupid most action movies from that era actually are. Even compared to the first "Hot Shots!", it holds up pretty well but I couldn't escape the sense that they were trying a bit too hard. What made the likes of "Airplane!" so special was the screenplay which was simply hilarious on its own. There was no need for special effects besides the crude aeroplane model being buffeted by lightning - the lines and performances were enough. Here, the gags are almost drowned out by the explosions and fire fights - each scene simply takes its cue from scenes in other films but replays them for laughs. Nothing wrong with that, as such, but I just preferred the earlier spoofs to these ones. And remember, it's been a long time since spoof movies enjoyed this level of success.

    If you are the hardcore movie fan, particularly comedy fan, this movie rocks! Everything is over the top, but only for a very big laugh from the audiences. I saw this movie after a long time of Charlie Sheen's big bad news. However, he had a great look of the main actor even in comedy movie. Lloyd Bridges also showed his outstanding performance as the poker face comedian. He made me think of the late Leslie Nielsen. Oh god! the United States has the Rambo president! Every gag that we see in this movie are non-sense, silly, and flawlessly laughing matter. However, I love this and I will grant that Hot Shots! Part Deux is one of the greatest comedy movie in all time!

    Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) has retired from the Navy and become a Buddhist in a small village. Colonel Walters (Richard Crenna) and Michelle Huddleston (Brenda Bakke), CIA, arrive and try to persuade Topper to come out of retirement in order to rescue a rescue party who went in to rescue a rescue party who are now hostages in Iraq. There is plenty of debate on the internet about who is hotter: Brenda Bakke or Valeria Golino. What a silly question -- Golino without a doubt! (I cannot say Golino is hot overall, I have not seen most of her work. But here she is gorgeous, and of course she was in "Big Top Pee-Wee" alongside her fianc&eacute;e Benicio De Toto.) Maybe this film is silly and has no plot... but I like it, and it gets better the more I am familiar with the films it spoofs. Charlie Sheen is winning in this film. Pure winning.

    I watched "Part Deux" just a day after the original and found it just a couple of notches below its predecessor. The spoof target is mainly "Rambo-First Blood", but as before many other films are referenced, like "Basic Instinct", "Apocalypse Now" (naturally) "Robin Hood Prince of Thieves" and even Disney's "The Lady and the Tramp". it's all part of the fun, of course, as well as making sure you watch the background, where a sight-gag is invariably playing. Charlie Sheen is all pumped up with somewhere to go, although this time I found too much camera time devoted to Lloyd Bridges' president, even if he does seem to anticipate Dubya years in advance. There are some comic gems, like the "Geronimo" sketch, heck I even laughed out loud at the map showing a no-man's land between Iraq and A Hard Place. If that kind of humour tickles you, there's plenty more, for better or worse, from where that came from, although the first in the series, where the characters and situations were fresher, in my opinion, edges out its follow-up in the comedy stakes.

    Jim Abrahams ran out of "Top Gun" jokes, so this sequel mainly focuses on the even more spoof-worthy "Rambo"-movies. Apart from that, it's pretty much the same as the first. And honestly, what could anyone have against that? This stuff is just hilarious in all its weirdness, I wouldn't want it any other way. Also Charlie Sheen still fits in so surprisingly well and Valeria Golino returns too because well, pretty girls with foreign accents make any movie better. Highlights include the inevitable breakings of the fourth wall, the "Apocalypse Now" spoof that comes from pretty much nowhere and the downright bizarre running gag with the birth mark. I also enjoyed pretty much every sequence featuring Saddam, because it just felt so delightfully wrong. This movie is exactly what you expect, which I guess is a good thing.

It's as if the film makers were pleading for legitimacy, saying that this is a proper spoof even if there is no Leslie Nielsen in it. I understand that "Rambo"-style films aren't exactly hard to spoof but "Hot Shots: Part Deux" does a decent job of bringing them down a peg or two. It isn't a laugh-a-minute mickey-take but it does make you smile and remind you how utterly stupid most action movies from that era actually are. Even compared to the first "Hot Shots!", it holds up pretty well but I couldn't escape the sense that they were trying a bit too hard. What made the likes of "Airplane!" so special was the screenplay which was simply hilarious on its own. There was no need for special effects besides the crude aeroplane model being buffeted by lightning - the lines and performances were enough. Here, the gags are almost drowned out by the explosions and fire fights - each scene simply takes its cue from scenes in other films but replays them for laughs. Nothing wrong with that, as such, but I just preferred the earlier spoofs to these ones. And remember, it's been a long time since spoof movies enjoyed this level of success.

    If you are the hardcore movie fan, particularly comedy fan, this movie rocks! Everything is over the top, but only for a very big laugh from the audiences. I saw this movie after a long time of Charlie Sheen's big bad news. However, he had a great look of the main actor even in comedy movie. Lloyd Bridges also showed his outstanding performance as the poker face comedian. He made me think of the late Leslie Nielsen. Oh god! the United States has the Rambo president! Every gag that we see in this movie are non-sense, silly, and flawlessly laughing matter. However, I love this and I will grant that Hot Shots! Part Deux is one of the greatest comedy movie in all time!

    Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) has retired from the Navy and become a Buddhist in a small village. Colonel Walters (Richard Crenna) and Michelle Huddleston (Brenda Bakke), CIA, arrive and try to persuade Topper to come out of retirement in order to rescue a rescue party who went in to rescue a rescue party who are now hostages in Iraq. There is plenty of debate on the internet about who is hotter: Brenda Bakke or Valeria Golino. What a silly question -- Golino without a doubt! (I cannot say Golino is hot overall, I have not seen most of her work. But here she is gorgeous, and of course she was in "Big Top Pee-Wee" alongside her fianc&eacute;e Benicio De Toto.) Maybe this film is silly and has no plot... but I like it, and it gets better the more I am familiar with the films it spoofs. Charlie Sheen is winning in this film. Pure winning.

    I watched "Part Deux" just a day after the original and found it just a couple of notches below its predecessor. The spoof target is mainly "Rambo-First Blood", but as before many other films are referenced, like "Basic Instinct", "Apocalypse Now" (naturally) "Robin Hood Prince of Thieves" and even Disney's "The Lady and the Tramp". it's all part of the fun, of course, as well as making sure you watch the background, where a sight-gag is invariably playing. Charlie Sheen is all pumped up with somewhere to go, although this time I found too much camera time devoted to Lloyd Bridges' president, even if he does seem to anticipate Dubya years in advance. There are some comic gems, like the "Geronimo" sketch, heck I even laughed out loud at the map showing a no-man's land between Iraq and A Hard Place. If that kind of humour tickles you, there's plenty more, for better or worse, from where that came from, although the first in the series, where the characters and situations were fresher, in my opinion, edges out its follow-up in the comedy stakes.

    Jim Abrahams ran out of "Top Gun" jokes, so this sequel mainly focuses on the even more spoof-worthy "Rambo"-movies. Apart from that, it's pretty much the same as the first. And honestly, what could anyone have against that? This stuff is just hilarious in all its weirdness, I wouldn't want it any other way. Also Charlie Sheen still fits in so surprisingly well and Valeria Golino returns too because well, pretty girls with foreign accents make any movie better. Highlights include the inevitable breakings of the fourth wall, the "Apocalypse Now" spoof that comes from pretty much nowhere and the downright bizarre running gag with the birth mark. I also enjoyed pretty much every sequence featuring Saddam, because it just felt so delightfully wrong. This movie is exactly what you expect, which I guess is a good thing.

    Following up the "Top Gun" parody with a "Rambo" parody, Pat Proft and Jim Abrams score a perfect 10 again. Starring Charlie Sheen, Lloyd Bridges, Valeria Golino, Miguel Ferrer, Rowan Atkinson, Bob Vila, and many more, this comedy nails its genre. Don't worry about the plot, just watch everything on screen a few times because you're still missing stuff. If you're old, you'll laugh at the name of the character Richard Crenna plays (Col. Denton Walters). Golino was Ramada Thompson in "Hot Shots!," but here she's Ramada Rodham Hayman. The other female characters include Michelle Rodham Huddleston, Lavinia Rodham Benson, and Mrs. Rodham Soto. This is a hilarious comedy that competent adults will appreciate.

    I don't know if I've ever seen a comedy as zany or as randomly silly as "Hot Shots! Part Deux." Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first "Hot Shots!" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds. Like its predecessor, Part Deux sets its plot as a parody of one specific film, but makes satirical parodies of dozens throughout its running time. The first movie was a parody of "Top Gun" but made references to dozens of other movies from "Dances With Wolves" to "Gone with the Wind." Likewise, the sequel is a parody of "Rambo III", but that's just the setup for all of the jokes that follow. Like Rambo, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is retired to the Far East when his former commander (Richard Crenna) comes in and asks him to join a rescue mission to save hostages from Iraqi captors. Sheen at first refuses but when Crenna is captured as he was in "Rambo III", Sheen heads in after him along with a misfit group of soldiers. And meanwhile, Admiral Benson (Lloyd Bridges) from the first movie has been promoted to president of the United States and continues his idiotic and incompetent running of the country. Now this is precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys. Why? Well, not only because it is so zany and buffoonish that one can't help but laugh at it, but because it's like a big mincemeat of movie references. The setup is a parody of "Rambo III", but I spotted parodies of "Casablanca", "Platoon" (which also starred Charlie Sheen), "Lady and the Tramp", "The Wizard of Oz", "Terminator 2" and so on. And just when I thought they were going to between two movies forget to parody "Star Wars", sure enough I got my fix for that. And that's not even the limit of it. The movie also makes jokes and points fingers at some of your favorite actors. A brief example is an enemy patrol boat that comes into the shot. The boat's name is "The Behn Gazaarah" as a tribute to actor Ben Gazzara. If you've seen lots of movies and you love the movies, this is the comedy for you because you can sit back, relax, have the time of your life laughing, and point your finger at the screen whenever a parody comes up and say "Yeah, that was from (insert movie title)!" "Hot Shots! Part Deux" opens up with a joke and closes with a joke and at least ninety percent of these are gut-busting in their effect. There are some jokes throughout the film, such as a few of the Saddam Hussein jokes toward the beginning, that were not all that funny, but around and after that were some of the zaniest, silliest, most random pratfalls I've ever seen. But it's also funny because it doesn't just make a simple parody and joke, but keeps pushing it one step ahead. Instead of just simply parodying the spaghetti-kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp", it carries it to the next step with Charlie Sheen pushing a meatball across the plate with his nose and then the scene morphs in a parody of "Casablanca." It's also not just enough for the movie to create a character like Richard Crenna's character in the Rambo series to be Sheen's former commanding officer. But to have Richard Crenna himself play the character and wear the same outfit and the same makeup and speak in the same rhythm and manner. And if there is one other element in this movie that I loved, it was the Lloyd Bridges character. Like the admiral he played in the first "Hot Shots!" Bridges plays the president of the United States, Thomas "Tug" Benson as simply a complete idiot, somebody so stupid that they could never, in real life, get a job running a grocery store let alone a country. And Bridges looks like he's having a good time playing the character, which in turn makes it very funny for the audience. In closing, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" is a tremendously enjoyable satirical comedy and precisely the sort of parody that I find entertaining. The key to its success is that it's so unbelievably random and silly and nonsensical. Whereas so many comedies I know try to do the same thing but just fail, it passes with flying colors. This is one funny movie.
