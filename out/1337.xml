    Bill Murray is one of those people who seem to be so natural and comfortable and just being himself on screen that it is difficult to name anyone else who appears to not be acting when up on that big rectangle glowing in the dark. It truly seems that most of the time a camera crew is simply following him around as he finds odd situations to get himself into and then without a bit of effort, make us laugh and feel that special something in our hearts. This is one of those movies and the odd situation he finds for himself is trying to get rid of an elephant left to him by his estranged and recently deceased father. This results in most of the movie being Bill talking to the elephant, not too much response from the big gray co-star but he does have a presence. And despite some of the other reviews saying otherwise, it works, and it works great for Bill Murray fans. It's as if he really is playing it off-the-cuff and it makes it all work. I really liked sprocketbox' metaphor of the elephant being the grieving process. Having lost the best friend I ever had about a year ago, my elephant hasn't gotten much smaller and so his metaphor hit me between the eyes frankly. There isn't an hour of a day when I still don't turn around and think "There's something I have to remember to tell ____ about" or "That's something _____ would find funny" and so on. That elephant is still there no matter where I turn. This is a movie well worth seeing and not just for Bill Murray fans. It's warm-hearted, relaxed, easy-going, and natural and much better than the five star rating given here.

    "Quick Change" director Howard Franklin and comedian Bill Murray have literally got a white elephant on their hands in the highly forgettable juvenile critter comedy "Larger than Life," co-starring Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo, Pat Hingle, Jeremy Piven, and Linda Fiorentino. Murray plays a motivational speaker who finds himself saddled with Velma, a female elephant that belonged to his recently deceased circus clown father whom he never met. When mom and pop went their separate ways, mom got Murray and pop kept the pachyderm. Now, pop's attorney (Harve Presnell of "Fargo") wants $35-thousand to cover the damages that Tarzan's best friend has chomped up while he waited on our hero to claim his inheritance. The only way that Jack Corcoran (Bill Murray of "Ghostbusters") can get off the tusk is to take the animal across country to a zoo, specifically to Mo (Janeane Garofalo) who is willing to buy Velma as part of a breeding experiment in India. This is Jack's first option. The second option, he learns, is a sexy animal trainer who is prepared to up the ante for Velma. The dilemma that Jack faces is who to sell the beast to, either the sympathetic but homely zoo keeper (Garofalo had a similar role in "The Truth about Cats and Dogs") or temptress animal trainer Terry Bonura (Linda Fiorentino), who uses electric prods to make her beasties behave. Getting the elephant there comprises the bulk of Roy Blount, Jr's lackluster, lead-footed plot. You could grow as old and wrinkled as an elephant waiting for an original laugh here. Jack and Velma travel by train, truck, and on foot, but they encounter trouble around every bend. Along the way, Jack tricks a paranoid, speed-freak truckers, Tip Tucker (Matthew McConaughey of "Dazed and Confused") into giving them a lift. When Tip learns that Jack has duped him, he raises a posse of state troopers who follow in hot pursuit, Jack blunders off the interstate and heads into the desert. Velma and he save an antique Spanish church from a flood. The grateful villagers idolize the elephant and helps Jack finish his cross-country jaunt. Film purists will have reason to complain. At one point, Jck dons the outfits that John Wayne wore in John Ford's 1949 classic "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" to elude Tucker. The filmmakers back up this costume change as Jack sticks to the back trails with Elmer Bernstein's classic "Magnificent Seven" theme. Talk about mixing movie metaphors! If you cannot figure out the ending, perhaps you should treat yourself to this shoddy farce that stretches its unlikely partners premises far beyond the breaking point. Either Bill Murray desperately want to produce a flop movie for tax purposes or he needed to return as a regular to NBC-TV's "Saturday Night Live."

    A man inherits an elephant from his father. What to do? This is a cute movie. A man on a cross country journey with his elephant. Tip Tucker was pretty funny,especially when he does his "How Do They Do It?!?" rant. There are people out here in the truckin industry like that,just like other trades. If Bill Murray actually drove the International with the cab tilted forward,that would be impressive. Bill Murray drives the International big rig. Rodney Bennett(I think)drives the Freightliner tanker big rig. Matthew McConaughey drives the Freightliner 18 wheeler. Bill Murray,Rodney Bennett, and Matthew McConaughhey are permanent A list actors. Linda Florentino,Janeane Gurofalo,and Maureen Mueller are hot!! ---One Truck Drivers Opinion--- erldwgstruckermovies.com

    I remember back in 1996 when I saw the trailer and television commercials for LARGER THAN LIFE - just seeing them, I *knew* that this was going to be a box office bomb. And I was right. This was not a case of a good movie being horribly marketed - this was a case of the badness of the movie being shown all too clearly. What went wrong? Well, I think that the main problem of the movie centers around the fact that pretty much all the events of the movie center around an elephant. Elephants are slow creatures, and although they can be trained to perform some tricks, they are still far from being creatures with a real charismatic personality. (Maybe if they got a quicker, wittier creature like a chimpanzee or a dog, it could have worked.) As a result of this movie being weighed down by an enormously ungraceful creature, there is no energy here. Even Murray, who has been quick and funny in other movies, seems overwhelmed. He does well in the opening scene where he's a motivational speaker, because he has *humans* to work with. When he's paired with the elephant, the energy immediately fades away. One question that's never answered in the movie is: Why doesn't Murray's character just hire someone to take the elephant to the west coast? It would be a lot less hassle, and Murray's character wouldn't have to skip his lecture dates. The fact that Murray's character doesn't do the obvious thing helps point out that the premise this script had was deeply flawed even before writing began.

    (Bill Murray) is one of the best actors and comedians in the last 20 years. So why to make a lame movie with an elephant? The answer : to be in business, to not be forgotten as a name in unstoppable ruthless industry, and to have a wonderful experience with an elephant BUT did we get any wonderful experience out of watching this ? I feel pity because of an easy script like this. So what was the meaning that the lead is a motivational speaker ?! and what exactly had changed in him after this trip ? and is there any intended similarity between him as a speaker and his father as a clown ? Then what was the running theme in this whole movie anyway ?!! I'm sorry, but the ultimate answer for all would be : NOTHING! OK, Matthew McConaughey plays cleverly a crazy driver (in the same year of his breakthrough A Time to Kill) although that was humorous lateral duel, but the script made him take part after the end of its first half !?? And event like the lead's fianc&eacute;e leaving him to marry his publisher (as the finale's board shows) pushes you to ask: Why she left him??! I think the "Trip" just affected the lead in a way to learn more lessons about life or to know what he really wants, and to discover more credibility around him. But all of that just in damned theoretical invisible way ! Even the end's sentimental situation looked fake with some line that hadn't much persuasion behind it so I can buy it anyway ! The major irony is super though it would've been better if the lead's character was animal hater, too pompous arrogant, selfish villainous who'll going to be redeemed by the events! So speaking of ironies I think the biggest of them all is that you have (Murray) with some trained lovely (Vera) through 3000 miles coast to coast 5-dayes odyssey and there isn't more than one laugh along the way !??? What a failure ! This movie got the very little, very cursory to present : touching moments (the elephant picks up tenderly the funny nose of her dead friend), comic time (Murray trying to choke McConaughey out of tedium), thrilling situations (the truck's one, and maybe the climax) and, sadly more than surprisingly, that was it ! As my review's title says, it didn't want to be a movie about characters, or character ! It didn't make much in area comic movies like (Any Which Way You Can - 1980) made a lot in it, and it's nothing like the polished peaceful family adventures that Disney produces yearly (at least they're meaningful !). So it was poor, tasteless, BLA BLA BLA, or wait a minute.. It really worked on that level, the level of making a good BLA BLA BLA ! All in all.. The only Larger Than Life thing in this movie was its title !

    Murray Only Has An Elephant To Bounce Off - It Doesn't Work...

    The over-riding problem with this film is that it can't possibly use Bill Murray to the best of his abilities, simply because of the co-star. If this was a road movie with another comedic actor, it might work. Even if they were both trying to get the elephant across the country, it would at least allow for them to share some amusing dialogue. As it stands, Murray is left talking to an elephant who cannot answer back with witty banter. Essentially, it means that Murray is talking to himself, and this makes the film more boring than it could have been had he had another character to bounce off. Kids would enjoy this movie,simply because of the elephant, but anyone wanting to watch Bill Murray's biting delivery and enjoy an excellent script needs to look somewhere else.

    LTL is the kind of formulaic, hopeless comedy to be enjoyed by the sort of sheep that stop and listen when they come across a band playing in a shopping mall. I remember Murray promoting LTL on Larry King's crappy CNN show, where he said something like "if this movie doesn't become a hit I'll stop making movies (or comedies)". He wasn't being nearly as jovial as one might think; he must have felt that LTL was a sure-fire hit and that its failure would mean his status as a star had markedly fallen - hence a sort-of ultimatum live-on-air to his fans to spend their hard-earned money on a dumb elephant comedy. (The comedy being dumb, not the elephant...) Or maybe he simply realized during the shooting (or when he saw the final cut) what a turkey this was, so he tried desperately to convince everyone how much optimism he had regarding LTL's quality. "Go see it, it really is good!" Actors are prostitutes inter-bred with car salesmen. LTL is the sort of lousy project that comes from the "Friends" school of comedy; their motto: "If you ever run out of ideas - or if you never had any in the first place - then stick an animal into the plot and that will at least inject an element of cuteness". Cuteness = a sad substitute for lack of funny gags. The other motto "Friends" had was: "always include pointless, dull sentimentality", which this movie so predictably ends with, when Murray rather pathetically says: "what they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant". Maybe not an elephant, but I certainly managed to easily forget this turkey, which I saw many years ago. I was suddenly reminded of it when I saw a scene from it on TV today (hence this equally pointless review). Murray wastes his talent on this turkey (disguised as an elephant), but he isn't nearly as uninteresting/bad as McConaughey (or however that man's name is spelt); one would think that M.M. would have an easy time playing himself, i.e. a hick, but he is so painfully unfunny and unconvincing that I could barely stand to watch him make such a jackass out of himself. It was cringe-worthy. To round off this nonsense, we have that generation-X buffoon, Garofalo, in a rather useless role. Then again, everything about LTL is useless... After LTL, which bombed as far as I know, Murray went on to become more of a "serious actor". What is it with these comedians and their inferiority complex? Is it all just about getting awards, i.e. "recognition from their peers" (read: votes from their moron colleagues)? This piece of crap marked the end of a string of good and great movies Murray made in the early- and mid-90s, such as "Groundhog Day", "Quick Change", "Mad Dog & Glory", "Kingpin", "What about Bob?" and "Ed Wood". Recently we've had the immeasurable pleasure of seeing him in garbage/mediocrities such as "Hamlet", "Lost In Translation" (you just can't get away from these "ultra-talented Coppolas"), and "Broken Flowers". Compare those two batches. One guy described LTL "funny as heck". Now THAT'S the kind of audience this movie was hoping for... Shopping malls and trailer parks...

    This was okay, but really a bit disappointing because I expected more laughs. Considering the storyline and the lead actor (Bill Murray), it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out to be. Only part of this made me really laugh, such as when Murray lost control of his semi and was speeding down the road at a weird angle. (You have to see it, to appreciate it.) The supporting cast was anything but likable people. Just look at a sampling of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role in here as "Tip Tucker" was just downright annoying. He was the worst. Other that those people, the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop.

    I have always liked Bill Murray in films like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for this film looked really good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically Murray plays Jack Corcorin who has recently found out that his father died, and he is expected to hear his will. He finds out that his father was a clown, because he left a large shoe, his squeaky nose, and his main inheritance, an elephant! The only way that Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4000 miles in four days and give him to a safe zoo for $30,000. Also starring Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are small tiny moments of humour, such as a truck's front bending forward, and Murray screaming, but overall, it's pointless. Pretty poor!

    How big is an elephant's heart? Just big enough to fill the amount of 'heart' poured into this great film. Because the casting director was brilliant enough to hire the superiorly (that's not a word, but i don't care! :p) brilliant comedian (who has kept his comedic roots - HE MAKES PPL LAUGH! - rather than go all 'im so special artsy iconoclastic' type) Bill Murray (who plays Jack Corcoran, the son of a professional clown - D'OH! how perfect is that?!? Bill is a comedian, clown, father, son... get it? I don't.) who fills the role perfectly. If it was _anybody_else_ in this role it would have been only a "family" movie and not be worth watching unless your kid is watching it. But because of Mr. Murray, this movie takes off. All the comedy is his, and it's all funny. Kids will like this also because it has an elephant in it. Kudos to every other actor who played smaller parts: Blockhead - Pat Hingle Tip Tucker (luny as a jaybird) - Matthew McConaughey (Matthew gets an extra set of kudos b/c his performance was over the top. Murray's ride with him is hilarious) Mo - Janeane Garofalo Terry - Linda Fiorentino Lawyer - Harve Presnell Train Conductor - Keith David Junkyard Guy - Greg Lewis, and last but not least, dear sweet Vera, played by Tal. :) Every time I see it it always brings a tear to my eye and manages to tug on my heart. I see it every time it comes out on TV. -Zafoid

That elephant is still there no matter where I turn. This is a movie well worth seeing and not just for Bill Murray fans. It's warm-hearted, relaxed, easy-going, and natural and much better than the five star rating given here.

It didn't make much in area comic movies like (Any Which Way You Can - 1980) made a lot in it, and it's nothing like the polished peaceful family adventures that Disney produces yearly (at least they're meaningful !). So it was poor, tasteless, BLA BLA BLA, or wait a minute.. It really worked on that level, the level of making a good BLA BLA BLA ! All in all.. The only Larger Than Life thing in this movie was its title !

    Murray Only Has An Elephant To Bounce Off - It Doesn't Work...

    The over-riding problem with this film is that it can't possibly use Bill Murray to the best of his abilities, simply because of the co-star. If this was a road movie with another comedic actor, it might work. Even if they were both trying to get the elephant across the country, it would at least allow for them to share some amusing dialogue. As it stands, Murray is left talking to an elephant who cannot answer back with witty banter. Essentially, it means that Murray is talking to himself, and this makes the film more boring than it could have been had he had another character to bounce off. Kids would enjoy this movie,simply because of the elephant, but anyone wanting to watch Bill Murray's biting delivery and enjoy an excellent script needs to look somewhere else.

    LTL is the kind of formulaic, hopeless comedy to be enjoyed by the sort of sheep that stop and listen when they come across a band playing in a shopping mall. I remember Murray promoting LTL on Larry King's crappy CNN show, where he said something like "if this movie doesn't become a hit I'll stop making movies (or comedies)". He wasn't being nearly as jovial as one might think; he must have felt that LTL was a sure-fire hit and that its failure would mean his status as a star had markedly fallen - hence a sort-of ultimatum live-on-air to his fans to spend their hard-earned money on a dumb elephant comedy. (The comedy being dumb, not the elephant...) Or maybe he simply realized during the shooting (or when he saw the final cut) what a turkey this was, so he tried desperately to convince everyone how much optimism he had regarding LTL's quality. "Go see it, it really is good!" Actors are prostitutes inter-bred with car salesmen. LTL is the sort of lousy project that comes from the "Friends" school of comedy; their motto: "If you ever run out of ideas - or if you never had any in the first place - then stick an animal into the plot and that will at least inject an element of cuteness". Cuteness = a sad substitute for lack of funny gags. The other motto "Friends" had was: "always include pointless, dull sentimentality", which this movie so predictably ends with, when Murray rather pathetically says: "what they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant". Maybe not an elephant, but I certainly managed to easily forget this turkey, which I saw many years ago. I was suddenly reminded of it when I saw a scene from it on TV today (hence this equally pointless review). Murray wastes his talent on this turkey (disguised as an elephant), but he isn't nearly as uninteresting/bad as McConaughey (or however that man's name is spelt); one would think that M.M. would have an easy time playing himself, i.e. a hick, but he is so painfully unfunny and unconvincing that I could barely stand to watch him make such a jackass out of himself. It was cringe-worthy. To round off this nonsense, we have that generation-X buffoon, Garofalo, in a rather useless role. Then again, everything about LTL is useless... After LTL, which bombed as far as I know, Murray went on to become more of a "serious actor". What is it with these comedians and their inferiority complex? Is it all just about getting awards, i.e. "recognition from their peers" (read: votes from their moron colleagues)? This piece of crap marked the end of a string of good and great movies Murray made in the early- and mid-90s, such as "Groundhog Day", "Quick Change", "Mad Dog & Glory", "Kingpin", "What about Bob?" and "Ed Wood". Recently we've had the immeasurable pleasure of seeing him in garbage/mediocrities such as "Hamlet", "Lost In Translation" (you just can't get away from these "ultra-talented Coppolas"), and "Broken Flowers". Compare those two batches. One guy described LTL "funny as heck". Now THAT'S the kind of audience this movie was hoping for... Shopping malls and trailer parks...

    This was okay, but really a bit disappointing because I expected more laughs. Considering the storyline and the lead actor (Bill Murray), it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out to be. Only part of this made me really laugh, such as when Murray lost control of his semi and was speeding down the road at a weird angle. (You have to see it, to appreciate it.) The supporting cast was anything but likable people. Just look at a sampling of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role in here as "Tip Tucker" was just downright annoying. He was the worst. Other that those people, the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop.

    I have always liked Bill Murray in films like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for this film looked really good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically Murray plays Jack Corcorin who has recently found out that his father died, and he is expected to hear his will. He finds out that his father was a clown, because he left a large shoe, his squeaky nose, and his main inheritance, an elephant! The only way that Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4000 miles in four days and give him to a safe zoo for $30,000. Also starring Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are small tiny moments of humour, such as a truck's front bending forward, and Murray screaming, but overall, it's pointless. Pretty poor!

    How big is an elephant's heart? Just big enough to fill the amount of 'heart' poured into this great film. Because the casting director was brilliant enough to hire the superiorly (that's not a word, but i don't care! :p) brilliant comedian (who has kept his comedic roots - HE MAKES PPL LAUGH! - rather than go all 'im so special artsy iconoclastic' type) Bill Murray (who plays Jack Corcoran, the son of a professional clown - D'OH! how perfect is that?!? Bill is a comedian, clown, father, son... get it? I don't.) who fills the role perfectly. If it was _anybody_else_ in this role it would have been only a "family" movie and not be worth watching unless your kid is watching it. But because of Mr. Murray, this movie takes off. All the comedy is his, and it's all funny. Kids will like this also because it has an elephant in it. Kudos to every other actor who played smaller parts: Blockhead - Pat Hingle Tip Tucker (luny as a jaybird) - Matthew McConaughey (Matthew gets an extra set of kudos b/c his performance was over the top. Murray's ride with him is hilarious) Mo - Janeane Garofalo Terry - Linda Fiorentino Lawyer - Harve Presnell Train Conductor - Keith David Junkyard Guy - Greg Lewis, and last but not least, dear sweet Vera, played by Tal. :) Every time I see it it always brings a tear to my eye and manages to tug on my heart. I see it every time it comes out on TV. -Zafoid

    Bill Murray is one of those people who seem to be so natural and comfortable and just being himself on screen that it is difficult to name anyone else who appears to not be acting when up on that big rectangle glowing in the dark. It truly seems that most of the time a camera crew is simply following him around as he finds odd situations to get himself into and then without a bit of effort, make us laugh and feel that special something in our hearts. This is one of those movies and the odd situation he finds for himself is trying to get rid of an elephant left to him by his estranged and recently deceased father. This results in most of the movie being Bill talking to the elephant, not too much response from the big gray co-star but he does have a presence. And despite some of the other reviews saying otherwise, it works, and it works great for Bill Murray fans. It's as if he really is playing it off-the-cuff and it makes it all work. I really liked sprocketbox' metaphor of the elephant being the grieving process. Having lost the best friend I ever had about a year ago, my elephant hasn't gotten much smaller and so his metaphor hit me between the eyes frankly. There isn't an hour of a day when I still don't turn around and think "There's something I have to remember to tell ____ about" or "That's something _____ would find funny" and so on. That elephant is still there no matter where I turn. This is a movie well worth seeing and not just for Bill Murray fans. It's warm-hearted, relaxed, easy-going, and natural and much better than the five star rating given here.

    "Quick Change" director Howard Franklin and comedian Bill Murray have literally got a white elephant on their hands in the highly forgettable juvenile critter comedy "Larger than Life," co-starring Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo, Pat Hingle, Jeremy Piven, and Linda Fiorentino. Murray plays a motivational speaker who finds himself saddled with Velma, a female elephant that belonged to his recently deceased circus clown father whom he never met. When mom and pop went their separate ways, mom got Murray and pop kept the pachyderm. Now, pop's attorney (Harve Presnell of "Fargo") wants $35-thousand to cover the damages that Tarzan's best friend has chomped up while he waited on our hero to claim his inheritance. The only way that Jack Corcoran (Bill Murray of "Ghostbusters") can get off the tusk is to take the animal across country to a zoo, specifically to Mo (Janeane Garofalo) who is willing to buy Velma as part of a breeding experiment in India. This is Jack's first option. The second option, he learns, is a sexy animal trainer who is prepared to up the ante for Velma. The dilemma that Jack faces is who to sell the beast to, either the sympathetic but homely zoo keeper (Garofalo had a similar role in "The Truth about Cats and Dogs") or temptress animal trainer Terry Bonura (Linda Fiorentino), who uses electric prods to make her beasties behave. Getting the elephant there comprises the bulk of Roy Blount, Jr's lackluster, lead-footed plot. You could grow as old and wrinkled as an elephant waiting for an original laugh here. Jack and Velma travel by train, truck, and on foot, but they encounter trouble around every bend. Along the way, Jack tricks a paranoid, speed-freak truckers, Tip Tucker (Matthew McConaughey of "Dazed and Confused") into giving them a lift. When Tip learns that Jack has duped him, he raises a posse of state troopers who follow in hot pursuit, Jack blunders off the interstate and heads into the desert. Velma and he save an antique Spanish church from a flood. The grateful villagers idolize the elephant and helps Jack finish his cross-country jaunt. Film purists will have reason to complain. At one point, Jck dons the outfits that John Wayne wore in John Ford's 1949 classic "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" to elude Tucker. The filmmakers back up this costume change as Jack sticks to the back trails with Elmer Bernstein's classic "Magnificent Seven" theme. Talk about mixing movie metaphors! If you cannot figure out the ending, perhaps you should treat yourself to this shoddy farce that stretches its unlikely partners premises far beyond the breaking point. Either Bill Murray desperately want to produce a flop movie for tax purposes or he needed to return as a regular to NBC-TV's "Saturday Night Live."

    A man inherits an elephant from his father. What to do? This is a cute movie. A man on a cross country journey with his elephant. Tip Tucker was pretty funny,especially when he does his "How Do They Do It?!?" rant. There are people out here in the truckin industry like that,just like other trades. If Bill Murray actually drove the International with the cab tilted forward,that would be impressive. Bill Murray drives the International big rig. Rodney Bennett(I think)drives the Freightliner tanker big rig. Matthew McConaughey drives the Freightliner 18 wheeler. Bill Murray,Rodney Bennett, and Matthew McConaughhey are permanent A list actors. Linda Florentino,Janeane Gurofalo,and Maureen Mueller are hot!! ---One Truck Drivers Opinion--- erldwgstruckermovies.com

    I remember back in 1996 when I saw the trailer and television commercials for LARGER THAN LIFE - just seeing them, I *knew* that this was going to be a box office bomb. And I was right. This was not a case of a good movie being horribly marketed - this was a case of the badness of the movie being shown all too clearly. What went wrong? Well, I think that the main problem of the movie centers around the fact that pretty much all the events of the movie center around an elephant. Elephants are slow creatures, and although they can be trained to perform some tricks, they are still far from being creatures with a real charismatic personality. (Maybe if they got a quicker, wittier creature like a chimpanzee or a dog, it could have worked.) As a result of this movie being weighed down by an enormously ungraceful creature, there is no energy here. Even Murray, who has been quick and funny in other movies, seems overwhelmed. He does well in the opening scene where he's a motivational speaker, because he has *humans* to work with. When he's paired with the elephant, the energy immediately fades away. One question that's never answered in the movie is: Why doesn't Murray's character just hire someone to take the elephant to the west coast? It would be a lot less hassle, and Murray's character wouldn't have to skip his lecture dates. The fact that Murray's character doesn't do the obvious thing helps point out that the premise this script had was deeply flawed even before writing began.

    (Bill Murray) is one of the best actors and comedians in the last 20 years. So why to make a lame movie with an elephant? The answer : to be in business, to not be forgotten as a name in unstoppable ruthless industry, and to have a wonderful experience with an elephant BUT did we get any wonderful experience out of watching this ? I feel pity because of an easy script like this. So what was the meaning that the lead is a motivational speaker ?! and what exactly had changed in him after this trip ? and is there any intended similarity between him as a speaker and his father as a clown ? Then what was the running theme in this whole movie anyway ?!! I'm sorry, but the ultimate answer for all would be : NOTHING! OK, Matthew McConaughey plays cleverly a crazy driver (in the same year of his breakthrough A Time to Kill) although that was humorous lateral duel, but the script made him take part after the end of its first half !?? And event like the lead's fianc&eacute;e leaving him to marry his publisher (as the finale's board shows) pushes you to ask: Why she left him??! I think the "Trip" just affected the lead in a way to learn more lessons about life or to know what he really wants, and to discover more credibility around him. But all of that just in damned theoretical invisible way ! Even the end's sentimental situation looked fake with some line that hadn't much persuasion behind it so I can buy it anyway ! The major irony is super though it would've been better if the lead's character was animal hater, too pompous arrogant, selfish villainous who'll going to be redeemed by the events! So speaking of ironies I think the biggest of them all is that you have (Murray) with some trained lovely (Vera) through 3000 miles coast to coast 5-dayes odyssey and there isn't more than one laugh along the way !??? What a failure ! This movie got the very little, very cursory to present : touching moments (the elephant picks up tenderly the funny nose of her dead friend), comic time (Murray trying to choke McConaughey out of tedium), thrilling situations (the truck's one, and maybe the climax) and, sadly more than surprisingly, that was it ! As my review's title says, it didn't want to be a movie about characters, or character ! It didn't make much in area comic movies like (Any Which Way You Can - 1980) made a lot in it, and it's nothing like the polished peaceful family adventures that Disney produces yearly (at least they're meaningful !). So it was poor, tasteless, BLA BLA BLA, or wait a minute.. It really worked on that level, the level of making a good BLA BLA BLA ! All in all.. The only Larger Than Life thing in this movie was its title !
