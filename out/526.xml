    One of the greatest Hollywood epics of all time, the first film ever to win the record amount of 11 Academy Awards, most of them well deserved. Charlton Heston stars as the Jewish nobleman Judah Ben-Hur, who finds out his once close friendship with the young Roman aristocrat Messala (Stephen Boyd) has succumbed to his strict duties as a Roman officer. This new distrust between them soon turns to hatred when, after an accident that leaves the new Roman governor of Judea wounded, Messala condemns Judah to the galleys as a slave and sends his family to the dungeons. However, Judah survives his ordeal, fueled by his hate, and in a grandiose naval battle between the Roman fleet and pirates, rescues the life of Roman Consul Arrius (Jack Hawkins), after which he is redeemed by the Emperor, adopted by Arrius and embarks on a star career as a charioteer before returning to Judea to seek vengeance on Messala in the sands of the most famous chariot race in film history. However, winning the race and fatally crippling his adversary in the process does not return his family or his happiness, things only Christ can give him on the Cross. For the majority of modern day viewers, the overt Christian overtones in the final third of the movie  the film is subtitled 'a Tale of the Christ after all  are hard to bear in their cheesiness, but this movie remains a solid undying classic in every other respect (with extra credit going to the great CinemaScope cinematography, the wonderful, catchy music and the excellent production design): the fabulous naval battle and the highly exciting chariot race remain unsurpassed.

    Well, 11 Oscras is not a mere trifle to forget about, but then, there are films that do not age well. Ben-Hur is of that caste, no matter what aficionados would say in anger. I watched it again and again very carefully to get the mood and see how well it speaks to us now. What do we have? The sub-title for the movie stated The Life Of The Christ - yes, Heis there, but this movie is not about Him and is not a Chrisitan movie. Wyler made a very typical grand scheme Hollywood blockbuster that impresses to some degree. Yes, but then, the glaring minuses speak up - 1. The film is tediously overlong, the absolutely unnecessary Prologue and Entr'Acte only kill time. 2. The blatantly obvious poorly painted backstage serving as a city or a valley look laughingly now, and obviously too cheap. 3. The play of main actors is not so deep, too. Overwrought and overblown emotions fit a theater stage more, here they look a bit funny, where it was not to be so. 4. Two most famous scenes - ship battle and horse ride are very long, too, and lack tension. They are well done, yes, but now they pale into banality. 5. The overall sentimental element is too much, too present, too loud that the whole epic dives into a syrupy melodrama. Well, this is a fine time-piece but that is all

    I recently watched this movie again after not seeing it for many years. It was a history lesson in a way, showing the brutality of the Romans, conflict between Rome and nearby nations, a chariot race, and well-known characters from the era (such as Pontius Pilate and Jesus). The action scenes are quite interesting, especially the chariot race - Remember that it wasn't as easy to do these back when the movie was made (no CGI during the 1950's). There are also a lot of themes in the movie (such as love, hate, death, healing, sadness, joy). The movie is long (more than 3 hours), and there are moments without much action, but I never felt bored while watching it. The movie is best appreciated by someone who knows about ancient Rome and Judea, and their culture (if you don't know any of this information the movie will be difficult to understand).

    There hasn't been a classic like the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur in so many years. Charleston Heston is at his best in this epic tale set in ancient Rome, of a man who faces the most dire of hardships for love and honor. It's a story of faith tested. How power can be used for corruption or for mankind's ultimate salvation! If they did a new remake of this film, I don't know if any actor could top this classic star. But with today's effects, I can't imagine how amazing this tale could be. I personally would love to do a remake. Hmm, what actor do you think might do a great remake? My picks might be; Christian Bale, Matt Bomer, Christian Cooke, Devon Sawa or Peter Facinelli for the lead role of Judah Ben-Hur. For the role of Quintus Arrius, Ben-Hur's rival, my picks might be; Ryan Gosling, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Sean Faris or Dave Annable. And for the role of Esther, my picks might be; Mila Kunis, Megan Fox, Lily James, Gal Gadot or Monica Raymund. If you love the classics and stories set in ancient Rome, this is a must see!!!

    Magnificent scenes, moving plot and excellent performances,everything is great! I like it! I once chose the film as the reference of thesis for an elective of my college. Because we could learn a lot of knowledge on the arrangement and design from the scenes of the movie. The 80s would not probably accept this film , I heard a lot of friends said: "The movie was okay!" However, I would think though it up to 4 hours, but it gives you a Open-minded feeling of the epic. And it also helped we to understand what was the artistic aesthetic then. Taken in 1959, era without computer special effects, but the picture is definitely a sense of the 21st century. Likewise the Roman theme, four decades later, even "Gladiator" with a lot of computer effects could not be compared to it.

    Uh. Sorry, folks. I know that Ben-Hur is considered by many to be an all-time classic, and everything, but, hey, aside from the chariot race (which was magnificently done), this dry-as-dust picture pushed the boundaries of monotony just a little too far for this reviewer with its 3.5 hour running time.... Yeah. It sure did. And, believe it or not, I actually sat through Ben-Hur's 3.5 hours of one over-long, dragged out scene after another and waited, and waited, and waited (ho-hum!) for something, anything worthwhile to take place, but it just didn't happen.... Nope. It didn't. (except, of course, for the chariot race) Ben-Hur was a literal biblical soap opera of epic proportions that seriously cried out for some major editing. At least a good hour could have easily been cut out of its story and I'm sure that no one would have ever noticed the diff, one way or the other. Maybe back in 1959 this film's fabricated magic might have worked on its audience like a mesmerizing spell, but that isn't the case today. No way. Considering that this film's tag-line is "A Tale of the Christ", Ben-Hur has got to be one of the most hollow and cheesy biblical stories ever captured on film. About the only memorable scene that the Christ character happened to appear in was when he was carrying his cross (or trying to) on his way to his own crucifixion - And he kept falling down - So someone had to give him a hand with carrying the thing. ( No. Not very impressive, if you ask me) Personally, I think that Ben-Hur was completely unworthy of winning a total of 11 Oscars. Particularly for its win for "Best Picture" (it was up against Anatomy For A Murder and The Diary Of Anne Frank) - And, especially, for "Best Actor", which went to that big phony-baloney with the whitest teeth, and brightest smile, Charlton Heston (who was up against James Stewart and Jack Lemmon). Yep. It was quite plain to see that everything about Ben-Hur said "expensive" (its budget was $16 million), but nothing about it was in the least bit inspirational. In spite of its big-name cast, and hordes-upon-hordes of extras, and all of its eye-popping sets and big-dollar production values, Ben-Hur was a small and petty and frivolous motion picture in so many, many ways.

    This is excellent for what it is, but what is it? Some will say it is an exciting blockbuster, others a Greek tragedy or heroic epic, or even cinematic opera with its focus on riveting but stagy drama and lush, harmonious cinemascope. It is of course all those things woven in one. The story is the same archetypal journey since Ulysses and Mahabharatathe hero is torn in the waking world of logical opposites, good and evil, duty to country against friendship and ambition, defeated with the divine trickery of a loose tile, thrust into hell to suffer oaring for some time, from where he emerges as a 'son' in splendid white clothes, and revitalized returns home to claim victory and love. That is the standard reading anyway such as you'd see in those screen writing guidebooks, not much interesting. It is at the same time a 'tale of the Christ', and this is a bit more fruitful in its spiritual dimension; the film does not end with material victory over the hated opponent, there is no peace to be found there. The idea is that the hero is properly a man when he learns to let go, forgive and accept transience. In this context, the journey is one of self realization not world redemption. You will see this with some clarity when Ben-Hur symbolically visits his mother and sister in some horrible underworld, but he realizes he cannot see them and only listens as they wish him well. Parting from there, he chances upon the Sermon on the Mountone of the three Magi of Bethlehem is there, a mentor who reveals that 'the child is now a man' (he is talking about Jesus) and we know this also applies on a second level to the protagonist. But he won't listen, being perhaps too proud or harried to sit and reflect, which only prolongs his torment for a while more, that is until he realizes who the rabbi is and follows the passions from up close. Oh the presentation is archaic and sermonizing, which is to say from the outside, symbolically presenting reflection but not making it the fabric so that you reflect. What is of more interest to me is noting this bit on the cinematic dimension: the contrast between a placid theatricality in the Jesus portions, with some exciting perspectives in the ship and chariot race segments which captivate the eye. The first is impersonal and removed from experience, imparting the awe of spectacle but not the spiritual essence, you will see for instance Calvary Hill as a stage in the distance. The latter exhibit a dynamism and placement of the eye inside the swirl of life, for instance the subjective shots of rowers looking out at the battle from ports in the hull of the galley or the powerful shots of dashing chariots as they hurl through the racetrack. There's cinematic energy here that sweeps you into what it is, instead of making you a spectator of opera. What is interesting is that the filmmaker, the very talented Wyler, had the immersive means but rested his hand outside the action.

    For more than 100 years, the tale of Ben Hur has staggered the imaginations of audiences worldwide, as indicated by its successful publication history, having at least three different film adaptations, and even a stage play adaptation. Of all the exposure this story has received, much of its acclaim may be attributed to its famous 1959 film adaptation, which remains a classic in epic cinema, and a standard Easter holiday favorite. Whether you've heard of Ben Hur or not, chances are good that you've seen this film referenced or mentioned somewhere in pop culture. It stands as one of the biggest, most epic, most ambitious productions in cinema to date. It's most impressive in how it employed thousands of extras, over a million props, and some very expensive and lavish setpieces to bring this larger-than-life tale to life. Even if you aren't marveling at the sheer scope and scale of this film, the chariot race in the film's final act will have you at the edge of your seat. It's a long, uncompromising, real-looking sequence that's still thrilling and intense, and it should stand as one of the best racing scenes of all time. There is a really neat sea battle in the film's first half, which offers even more thrills and violence to behold. For the most part, however, this is a film more heavily built on drama and characterization. Parts of it remain enthralling, as we watch the title character suffer and fight his way through adversity. However, in between the major turning events and the action scenes, the film's momentum does suffer a massive slump. The pacing in certain scenes never agreed with me personally, and is really the only issue I take with this fine picture. The story for this film is perfectly sound and well-built. Judah Ben Hur is a well-rounded character we can follow easily enough and relate to; his rivalry with Messala provides the conflict to drive the plot forward, and digs up some interesting themes of vengeance and hatred. What really propels the film above and beyond will be the story of Christ, running in tandem with Ben Hur's story; both story lines become entwined to reveal strong themes of redemption and salvation. I have no clue how closely this adapts Lew Wallace's original novel, but on its own merits, this film offers a decently insightful story. Captured with a sweeping widescreen frame on a pristine 70mm film stock, this film looks every bit as big as it is. Just about every shot is carefully calculated to best present the imagery with incredible amounts of detail. It uses a lot of long shots, which never felt all that intimate or interesting to me personally, but it is definitely a big-scale picture with lots of impressive shots. Acting is pleasing; Charlton Heston plays Ben Hur with enough nuance and machismo to make the character cool and memorable. The rest of the cast do their best. Writing is not too bad either. This production spares no expense on its massive sets, props, costumes, and visual effects. Music is just as big and ambitious as the rest of the movie is. For its sheer epicness and classic status, this film comes highly recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)

    I want to begin by saying that I watched this film...again...on Easter weekend, and, by coincidence, when I had just learned that MGM is planning a remake. I'm usually not a big fan of remakes, but I think in this case it will -- at the very least -- be interesting. I understand that the new script will be closer to the story as written by General Lew Wallace. Let me skip to my recent experience of watching the new Oz film...not bad...enjoyable...but knowing that virtually every scene in that movie was filmed in front of a blue/green screen kinda ruined it for me...I felt as if the actors were simply placed within a cartoon. Much as the rather over-the-top special effects in the final Indiana Jones movie ruined that for me. There's nothing wrong with special effects...they're in all films to some degree or another...but it's getting to the point where so many films focus on the special effects that we are losing the ability to judge fine acting and fine script-writing. I fear the remake of "Ben-Hur" may end of that way, also -- a special effects extravaganza that will make the new film a shadow of this classic. I mentioned that this is my second-favorite film...just behind "Gone With The Wind", and that's partly because each had a superior story, and each was ahead of its time in terms of sheer movie-making. It seems to me that "Ben-Hur" pretty much has it all, beginning with a superb story (even if you're not a Christian) and a very fine script. And then there's the acting. I'm going to hand out so many kudos here, that I feel I should begin with the one performance that was shallow and so passive as to be nearly worthless -- that of Cathy O'Donnell as Ben-Hur's sister, Tirzah. How bland can an actress get? O'Donnell answered that question definitively. No wonder this was her final film, and that after this she showed up in mostly bit parts on television. Charleton Heston is an actor that I simply can't stand any longer. I won't watch any of his films, with two exceptions: "The Ten Commandments" (because it's hard to resist the spectacle of a Cecil B. DeMille film) and "Ben-Hur". As much as I dislike the man because of his political stands, I have to admit that his acting here is absolutely superb and spot-on. His performance as a man who is constantly evolving here, is nothing short of phenomenal. Heston had a few other great performances, but this is the one that stands out and forms the basis of his legacy. We only see Jack Hawkins in on part of the film -- from the battleship to Rome -- but his performance is also right on target. Interestingly, he didn't want to do another spectacle film so soon after "Bridge On The River Kwai", which is probably a better role and performance. But he's still excellent here. Incidentally, this film was made shortly after he had gone through cobalt treatments for what eventually turned out to be throat cancer, which killed him at a relatively young age. Haya Harareet was an Israeli actress who only made 9 films in her career. Nevertheless, even aside from her beauty, this film is her finest performance, and I felt worthy of an Oscar nomination. Stephen Boyd also gave his finest performance in this film, and was just right as the selfish and spiteful antagonist. The whole controversy over whether or not he played his role as if he was a jilted gay lover spurned by Ben-Hur is an interesting one, and based on interviews with Gore Vidal. Hugh Girffith is very good as the Arab sheik. Martha Scott is not a well-remembered actress, but I always thought she was very good and very underrated. As Ben-Hur's mother here, she turns in another durable performance. Sam Jaffe is a treasure as Simonides, and this performance rivals his performance as the abbot in 1937's "Lost Horizon". I have always enjoyed Finlay Currie's performance as Balthazar in this film, and only recently have been discovering some other fine performances by the Scottish actor ("I Know Where I'm Going" and "People Will Talk"). And finally, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate is terrific. And last but not least -- the spectacle. "And a cast of thousands" is certainly true here, excellent sets (particularly for the chariot race), and of course -- that chariot race...probably film-making at its finest and most spectacular. This has it all, with few complaints. This kind of product makes Hollywood proud.

    This is one of what I call the "untouchable" movies and, along with other pieces, this is very hard to rate and review, so I usually avoid that (specially because of the usual aggression that comes from people who think high of those movies). In this case there is one particular aggravation: the quantity of Academy Awards this movie got. As we all know, this is, for many people, a measure of how good a movie is or isn't. Not seeing how much the Academy Awards is biased is, at least for me, a matter of choice (and also a lack of any sense). Being biased or not in this case, and as much as I don't want to, I feel like I should say something about this movie, so here it goes. This movie is as shallow as the ideals of those it tries to please, filled with the standard hypocrisy and bigotry you'll find in most of their minds. It's so pretensions and the acting is so hideous and corny that it's hard to believe that all of the hype around it can still exist, as you think that as time passes people would be more intelligent and critical, and would reject an abomination like this. Charlton Heston is nothing special, but he is particularly bad in this movie. This is a movie that was made to be BIG, and this is where everything revolves for it. It's an epic movie, with an epic number of extras, an epic spending on costumes and setting and equipment and an epic (debatable) soundtrack, which was specifically designed to snatch Oscars. However, from the story to the character development, this is incredibly inferior to many other epics of that time that are much more historically accurate than Ben-Hur and much better executed, with better acting and with more solid plots. The film considers itself to be not only an epic "historical" account, but also thinks it has a deeper meaning. It relies heavily on an appeal to some values, while it tries to develop in the background a story of love, friendship and revenge. It fails miserably in all of those aspects. It fails to convey a meaningful message because its values are devoid of any deepness and usually end up in contradictions. Thus, all of the actions that happen in the movie that are supposed to be linked with these values become meaningless: the conflict of the urge for revenge, etc. The childish notions of love and goodness that it conveys end up spoiling the movie, because this was clearly made for (and to impress.. and sorry for the bluntness).... Christians. It ends up being like a big Sunday school, with artsy cameos by JC himself (in the distance, or off screen, and never showing his face because, you know, it's more artsy that way, and it's also deep, like the "message" of this movie). Some religiosity in movies won't bother you that much, but this one just overdo it, and shows that this was clearly devised for Christian audiences. However, it also fails in the underlining story of Ben-Hur. His love and friendship relationships do not convince, maybe because of Academy Award winner Charlton Heston's (his performance in SOYLENT GREEN is better than this one, seriously) performance, but probably because of the poor development of the characters, which the movie clearly sacrifices to try and push its values to the audience. The costumes, the editing, everything is incredible (except the acting and the plot), and also the infamous chariot race is very well executed, so even if this movie is very slow paced it's still watchable. However, it's dull, with an acting that is hard on the eyes, and very pretentious for a movie with values so shallow and devoid of meaning. Rating: 6,5/10 (I round ratings down)

But with today's effects, I can't imagine how amazing this tale could be. I personally would love to do a remake. Hmm, what actor do you think might do a great remake? My picks might be; Christian Bale, Matt Bomer, Christian Cooke, Devon Sawa or Peter Facinelli for the lead role of Judah Ben-Hur. For the role of Quintus Arrius, Ben-Hur's rival, my picks might be; Ryan Gosling, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Sean Faris or Dave Annable. And for the role of Esther, my picks might be; Mila Kunis, Megan Fox, Lily James, Gal Gadot or Monica Raymund. If you love the classics and stories set in ancient Rome, this is a must see!!!

    Magnificent scenes, moving plot and excellent performances,everything is great! I like it! I once chose the film as the reference of thesis for an elective of my college. Because we could learn a lot of knowledge on the arrangement and design from the scenes of the movie. The 80s would not probably accept this film , I heard a lot of friends said: "The movie was okay!" However, I would think though it up to 4 hours, but it gives you a Open-minded feeling of the epic. And it also helped we to understand what was the artistic aesthetic then. Taken in 1959, era without computer special effects, but the picture is definitely a sense of the 21st century. Likewise the Roman theme, four decades later, even "Gladiator" with a lot of computer effects could not be compared to it.

    Uh. Sorry, folks. I know that Ben-Hur is considered by many to be an all-time classic, and everything, but, hey, aside from the chariot race (which was magnificently done), this dry-as-dust picture pushed the boundaries of monotony just a little too far for this reviewer with its 3.5 hour running time.... Yeah. It sure did. And, believe it or not, I actually sat through Ben-Hur's 3.5 hours of one over-long, dragged out scene after another and waited, and waited, and waited (ho-hum!) for something, anything worthwhile to take place, but it just didn't happen.... Nope. It didn't. (except, of course, for the chariot race) Ben-Hur was a literal biblical soap opera of epic proportions that seriously cried out for some major editing. At least a good hour could have easily been cut out of its story and I'm sure that no one would have ever noticed the diff, one way or the other. Maybe back in 1959 this film's fabricated magic might have worked on its audience like a mesmerizing spell, but that isn't the case today. No way. Considering that this film's tag-line is "A Tale of the Christ", Ben-Hur has got to be one of the most hollow and cheesy biblical stories ever captured on film. About the only memorable scene that the Christ character happened to appear in was when he was carrying his cross (or trying to) on his way to his own crucifixion - And he kept falling down - So someone had to give him a hand with carrying the thing. ( No. Not very impressive, if you ask me) Personally, I think that Ben-Hur was completely unworthy of winning a total of 11 Oscars. Particularly for its win for "Best Picture" (it was up against Anatomy For A Murder and The Diary Of Anne Frank) - And, especially, for "Best Actor", which went to that big phony-baloney with the whitest teeth, and brightest smile, Charlton Heston (who was up against James Stewart and Jack Lemmon). Yep. It was quite plain to see that everything about Ben-Hur said "expensive" (its budget was $16 million), but nothing about it was in the least bit inspirational. In spite of its big-name cast, and hordes-upon-hordes of extras, and all of its eye-popping sets and big-dollar production values, Ben-Hur was a small and petty and frivolous motion picture in so many, many ways.

    This is excellent for what it is, but what is it? Some will say it is an exciting blockbuster, others a Greek tragedy or heroic epic, or even cinematic opera with its focus on riveting but stagy drama and lush, harmonious cinemascope. It is of course all those things woven in one. The story is the same archetypal journey since Ulysses and Mahabharatathe hero is torn in the waking world of logical opposites, good and evil, duty to country against friendship and ambition, defeated with the divine trickery of a loose tile, thrust into hell to suffer oaring for some time, from where he emerges as a 'son' in splendid white clothes, and revitalized returns home to claim victory and love. That is the standard reading anyway such as you'd see in those screen writing guidebooks, not much interesting. It is at the same time a 'tale of the Christ', and this is a bit more fruitful in its spiritual dimension; the film does not end with material victory over the hated opponent, there is no peace to be found there. The idea is that the hero is properly a man when he learns to let go, forgive and accept transience. In this context, the journey is one of self realization not world redemption. You will see this with some clarity when Ben-Hur symbolically visits his mother and sister in some horrible underworld, but he realizes he cannot see them and only listens as they wish him well. Parting from there, he chances upon the Sermon on the Mountone of the three Magi of Bethlehem is there, a mentor who reveals that 'the child is now a man' (he is talking about Jesus) and we know this also applies on a second level to the protagonist. But he won't listen, being perhaps too proud or harried to sit and reflect, which only prolongs his torment for a while more, that is until he realizes who the rabbi is and follows the passions from up close. Oh the presentation is archaic and sermonizing, which is to say from the outside, symbolically presenting reflection but not making it the fabric so that you reflect. What is of more interest to me is noting this bit on the cinematic dimension: the contrast between a placid theatricality in the Jesus portions, with some exciting perspectives in the ship and chariot race segments which captivate the eye. The first is impersonal and removed from experience, imparting the awe of spectacle but not the spiritual essence, you will see for instance Calvary Hill as a stage in the distance. The latter exhibit a dynamism and placement of the eye inside the swirl of life, for instance the subjective shots of rowers looking out at the battle from ports in the hull of the galley or the powerful shots of dashing chariots as they hurl through the racetrack. There's cinematic energy here that sweeps you into what it is, instead of making you a spectator of opera. What is interesting is that the filmmaker, the very talented Wyler, had the immersive means but rested his hand outside the action.

    For more than 100 years, the tale of Ben Hur has staggered the imaginations of audiences worldwide, as indicated by its successful publication history, having at least three different film adaptations, and even a stage play adaptation. Of all the exposure this story has received, much of its acclaim may be attributed to its famous 1959 film adaptation, which remains a classic in epic cinema, and a standard Easter holiday favorite. Whether you've heard of Ben Hur or not, chances are good that you've seen this film referenced or mentioned somewhere in pop culture. It stands as one of the biggest, most epic, most ambitious productions in cinema to date. It's most impressive in how it employed thousands of extras, over a million props, and some very expensive and lavish setpieces to bring this larger-than-life tale to life. Even if you aren't marveling at the sheer scope and scale of this film, the chariot race in the film's final act will have you at the edge of your seat. It's a long, uncompromising, real-looking sequence that's still thrilling and intense, and it should stand as one of the best racing scenes of all time. There is a really neat sea battle in the film's first half, which offers even more thrills and violence to behold. For the most part, however, this is a film more heavily built on drama and characterization. Parts of it remain enthralling, as we watch the title character suffer and fight his way through adversity. However, in between the major turning events and the action scenes, the film's momentum does suffer a massive slump. The pacing in certain scenes never agreed with me personally, and is really the only issue I take with this fine picture. The story for this film is perfectly sound and well-built. Judah Ben Hur is a well-rounded character we can follow easily enough and relate to; his rivalry with Messala provides the conflict to drive the plot forward, and digs up some interesting themes of vengeance and hatred. What really propels the film above and beyond will be the story of Christ, running in tandem with Ben Hur's story; both story lines become entwined to reveal strong themes of redemption and salvation. I have no clue how closely this adapts Lew Wallace's original novel, but on its own merits, this film offers a decently insightful story. Captured with a sweeping widescreen frame on a pristine 70mm film stock, this film looks every bit as big as it is. Just about every shot is carefully calculated to best present the imagery with incredible amounts of detail. It uses a lot of long shots, which never felt all that intimate or interesting to me personally, but it is definitely a big-scale picture with lots of impressive shots. Acting is pleasing; Charlton Heston plays Ben Hur with enough nuance and machismo to make the character cool and memorable. The rest of the cast do their best. Writing is not too bad either. This production spares no expense on its massive sets, props, costumes, and visual effects. Music is just as big and ambitious as the rest of the movie is. For its sheer epicness and classic status, this film comes highly recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)

    I want to begin by saying that I watched this film...again...on Easter weekend, and, by coincidence, when I had just learned that MGM is planning a remake. I'm usually not a big fan of remakes, but I think in this case it will -- at the very least -- be interesting. I understand that the new script will be closer to the story as written by General Lew Wallace. Let me skip to my recent experience of watching the new Oz film...not bad...enjoyable...but knowing that virtually every scene in that movie was filmed in front of a blue/green screen kinda ruined it for me...I felt as if the actors were simply placed within a cartoon. Much as the rather over-the-top special effects in the final Indiana Jones movie ruined that for me. There's nothing wrong with special effects...they're in all films to some degree or another...but it's getting to the point where so many films focus on the special effects that we are losing the ability to judge fine acting and fine script-writing. I fear the remake of "Ben-Hur" may end of that way, also -- a special effects extravaganza that will make the new film a shadow of this classic. I mentioned that this is my second-favorite film...just behind "Gone With The Wind", and that's partly because each had a superior story, and each was ahead of its time in terms of sheer movie-making. It seems to me that "Ben-Hur" pretty much has it all, beginning with a superb story (even if you're not a Christian) and a very fine script. And then there's the acting. I'm going to hand out so many kudos here, that I feel I should begin with the one performance that was shallow and so passive as to be nearly worthless -- that of Cathy O'Donnell as Ben-Hur's sister, Tirzah. How bland can an actress get? O'Donnell answered that question definitively. No wonder this was her final film, and that after this she showed up in mostly bit parts on television. Charleton Heston is an actor that I simply can't stand any longer. I won't watch any of his films, with two exceptions: "The Ten Commandments" (because it's hard to resist the spectacle of a Cecil B. DeMille film) and "Ben-Hur". As much as I dislike the man because of his political stands, I have to admit that his acting here is absolutely superb and spot-on. His performance as a man who is constantly evolving here, is nothing short of phenomenal. Heston had a few other great performances, but this is the one that stands out and forms the basis of his legacy. We only see Jack Hawkins in on part of the film -- from the battleship to Rome -- but his performance is also right on target. Interestingly, he didn't want to do another spectacle film so soon after "Bridge On The River Kwai", which is probably a better role and performance. But he's still excellent here. Incidentally, this film was made shortly after he had gone through cobalt treatments for what eventually turned out to be throat cancer, which killed him at a relatively young age. Haya Harareet was an Israeli actress who only made 9 films in her career. Nevertheless, even aside from her beauty, this film is her finest performance, and I felt worthy of an Oscar nomination. Stephen Boyd also gave his finest performance in this film, and was just right as the selfish and spiteful antagonist. The whole controversy over whether or not he played his role as if he was a jilted gay lover spurned by Ben-Hur is an interesting one, and based on interviews with Gore Vidal. Hugh Girffith is very good as the Arab sheik. Martha Scott is not a well-remembered actress, but I always thought she was very good and very underrated. As Ben-Hur's mother here, she turns in another durable performance. Sam Jaffe is a treasure as Simonides, and this performance rivals his performance as the abbot in 1937's "Lost Horizon". I have always enjoyed Finlay Currie's performance as Balthazar in this film, and only recently have been discovering some other fine performances by the Scottish actor ("I Know Where I'm Going" and "People Will Talk"). And finally, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate is terrific. And last but not least -- the spectacle. "And a cast of thousands" is certainly true here, excellent sets (particularly for the chariot race), and of course -- that chariot race...probably film-making at its finest and most spectacular. This has it all, with few complaints. This kind of product makes Hollywood proud.

    This is one of what I call the "untouchable" movies and, along with other pieces, this is very hard to rate and review, so I usually avoid that (specially because of the usual aggression that comes from people who think high of those movies). In this case there is one particular aggravation: the quantity of Academy Awards this movie got. As we all know, this is, for many people, a measure of how good a movie is or isn't. Not seeing how much the Academy Awards is biased is, at least for me, a matter of choice (and also a lack of any sense). Being biased or not in this case, and as much as I don't want to, I feel like I should say something about this movie, so here it goes. This movie is as shallow as the ideals of those it tries to please, filled with the standard hypocrisy and bigotry you'll find in most of their minds. It's so pretensions and the acting is so hideous and corny that it's hard to believe that all of the hype around it can still exist, as you think that as time passes people would be more intelligent and critical, and would reject an abomination like this. Charlton Heston is nothing special, but he is particularly bad in this movie. This is a movie that was made to be BIG, and this is where everything revolves for it. It's an epic movie, with an epic number of extras, an epic spending on costumes and setting and equipment and an epic (debatable) soundtrack, which was specifically designed to snatch Oscars. However, from the story to the character development, this is incredibly inferior to many other epics of that time that are much more historically accurate than Ben-Hur and much better executed, with better acting and with more solid plots. The film considers itself to be not only an epic "historical" account, but also thinks it has a deeper meaning. It relies heavily on an appeal to some values, while it tries to develop in the background a story of love, friendship and revenge. It fails miserably in all of those aspects. It fails to convey a meaningful message because its values are devoid of any deepness and usually end up in contradictions. Thus, all of the actions that happen in the movie that are supposed to be linked with these values become meaningless: the conflict of the urge for revenge, etc. The childish notions of love and goodness that it conveys end up spoiling the movie, because this was clearly made for (and to impress.. and sorry for the bluntness).... Christians. It ends up being like a big Sunday school, with artsy cameos by JC himself (in the distance, or off screen, and never showing his face because, you know, it's more artsy that way, and it's also deep, like the "message" of this movie). Some religiosity in movies won't bother you that much, but this one just overdo it, and shows that this was clearly devised for Christian audiences. However, it also fails in the underlining story of Ben-Hur. His love and friendship relationships do not convince, maybe because of Academy Award winner Charlton Heston's (his performance in SOYLENT GREEN is better than this one, seriously) performance, but probably because of the poor development of the characters, which the movie clearly sacrifices to try and push its values to the audience. The costumes, the editing, everything is incredible (except the acting and the plot), and also the infamous chariot race is very well executed, so even if this movie is very slow paced it's still watchable. However, it's dull, with an acting that is hard on the eyes, and very pretentious for a movie with values so shallow and devoid of meaning. Rating: 6,5/10 (I round ratings down)

    One of the greatest Hollywood epics of all time, the first film ever to win the record amount of 11 Academy Awards, most of them well deserved. Charlton Heston stars as the Jewish nobleman Judah Ben-Hur, who finds out his once close friendship with the young Roman aristocrat Messala (Stephen Boyd) has succumbed to his strict duties as a Roman officer. This new distrust between them soon turns to hatred when, after an accident that leaves the new Roman governor of Judea wounded, Messala condemns Judah to the galleys as a slave and sends his family to the dungeons. However, Judah survives his ordeal, fueled by his hate, and in a grandiose naval battle between the Roman fleet and pirates, rescues the life of Roman Consul Arrius (Jack Hawkins), after which he is redeemed by the Emperor, adopted by Arrius and embarks on a star career as a charioteer before returning to Judea to seek vengeance on Messala in the sands of the most famous chariot race in film history. However, winning the race and fatally crippling his adversary in the process does not return his family or his happiness, things only Christ can give him on the Cross. For the majority of modern day viewers, the overt Christian overtones in the final third of the movie  the film is subtitled 'a Tale of the Christ after all  are hard to bear in their cheesiness, but this movie remains a solid undying classic in every other respect (with extra credit going to the great CinemaScope cinematography, the wonderful, catchy music and the excellent production design): the fabulous naval battle and the highly exciting chariot race remain unsurpassed.

    Well, 11 Oscras is not a mere trifle to forget about, but then, there are films that do not age well. Ben-Hur is of that caste, no matter what aficionados would say in anger. I watched it again and again very carefully to get the mood and see how well it speaks to us now. What do we have? The sub-title for the movie stated The Life Of The Christ - yes, Heis there, but this movie is not about Him and is not a Chrisitan movie. Wyler made a very typical grand scheme Hollywood blockbuster that impresses to some degree. Yes, but then, the glaring minuses speak up - 1. The film is tediously overlong, the absolutely unnecessary Prologue and Entr'Acte only kill time. 2. The blatantly obvious poorly painted backstage serving as a city or a valley look laughingly now, and obviously too cheap. 3. The play of main actors is not so deep, too. Overwrought and overblown emotions fit a theater stage more, here they look a bit funny, where it was not to be so. 4. Two most famous scenes - ship battle and horse ride are very long, too, and lack tension. They are well done, yes, but now they pale into banality. 5. The overall sentimental element is too much, too present, too loud that the whole epic dives into a syrupy melodrama. Well, this is a fine time-piece but that is all

    I recently watched this movie again after not seeing it for many years. It was a history lesson in a way, showing the brutality of the Romans, conflict between Rome and nearby nations, a chariot race, and well-known characters from the era (such as Pontius Pilate and Jesus). The action scenes are quite interesting, especially the chariot race - Remember that it wasn't as easy to do these back when the movie was made (no CGI during the 1950's). There are also a lot of themes in the movie (such as love, hate, death, healing, sadness, joy). The movie is long (more than 3 hours), and there are moments without much action, but I never felt bored while watching it. The movie is best appreciated by someone who knows about ancient Rome and Judea, and their culture (if you don't know any of this information the movie will be difficult to understand).

    There hasn't been a classic like the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur in so many years. Charleston Heston is at his best in this epic tale set in ancient Rome, of a man who faces the most dire of hardships for love and honor. It's a story of faith tested. How power can be used for corruption or for mankind's ultimate salvation! If they did a new remake of this film, I don't know if any actor could top this classic star.

    For more than 100 years, the tale of Ben Hur has staggered the imaginations of audiences worldwide, as indicated by its successful publication history, having at least three different film adaptations, and even a stage play adaptation. Of all the exposure this story has received, much of its acclaim may be attributed to its famous 1959 film adaptation, which remains a classic in epic cinema, and a standard Easter holiday favorite. Whether you've heard of Ben Hur or not, chances are good that you've seen this film referenced or mentioned somewhere in pop culture. It stands as one of the biggest, most epic, most ambitious productions in cinema to date. It's most impressive in how it employed thousands of extras, over a million props, and some very expensive and lavish setpieces to bring this larger-than-life tale to life. Even if you aren't marveling at the sheer scope and scale of this film, the chariot race in the film's final act will have you at the edge of your seat. It's a long, uncompromising, real-looking sequence that's still thrilling and intense, and it should stand as one of the best racing scenes of all time. There is a really neat sea battle in the film's first half, which offers even more thrills and violence to behold. For the most part, however, this is a film more heavily built on drama and characterization. Parts of it remain enthralling, as we watch the title character suffer and fight his way through adversity. However, in between the major turning events and the action scenes, the film's momentum does suffer a massive slump. The pacing in certain scenes never agreed with me personally, and is really the only issue I take with this fine picture. The story for this film is perfectly sound and well-built. Judah Ben Hur is a well-rounded character we can follow easily enough and relate to; his rivalry with Messala provides the conflict to drive the plot forward, and digs up some interesting themes of vengeance and hatred. What really propels the film above and beyond will be the story of Christ, running in tandem with Ben Hur's story; both story lines become entwined to reveal strong themes of redemption and salvation. I have no clue how closely this adapts Lew Wallace's original novel, but on its own merits, this film offers a decently insightful story. Captured with a sweeping widescreen frame on a pristine 70mm film stock, this film looks every bit as big as it is. Just about every shot is carefully calculated to best present the imagery with incredible amounts of detail. It uses a lot of long shots, which never felt all that intimate or interesting to me personally, but it is definitely a big-scale picture with lots of impressive shots. Acting is pleasing; Charlton Heston plays Ben Hur with enough nuance and machismo to make the character cool and memorable. The rest of the cast do their best. Writing is not too bad either. This production spares no expense on its massive sets, props, costumes, and visual effects. Music is just as big and ambitious as the rest of the movie is. For its sheer epicness and classic status, this film comes highly recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)

    I want to begin by saying that I watched this film...again...on Easter weekend, and, by coincidence, when I had just learned that MGM is planning a remake. I'm usually not a big fan of remakes, but I think in this case it will -- at the very least -- be interesting. I understand that the new script will be closer to the story as written by General Lew Wallace. Let me skip to my recent experience of watching the new Oz film...not bad...enjoyable...but knowing that virtually every scene in that movie was filmed in front of a blue/green screen kinda ruined it for me...I felt as if the actors were simply placed within a cartoon. Much as the rather over-the-top special effects in the final Indiana Jones movie ruined that for me. There's nothing wrong with special effects...they're in all films to some degree or another...but it's getting to the point where so many films focus on the special effects that we are losing the ability to judge fine acting and fine script-writing. I fear the remake of "Ben-Hur" may end of that way, also -- a special effects extravaganza that will make the new film a shadow of this classic. I mentioned that this is my second-favorite film...just behind "Gone With The Wind", and that's partly because each had a superior story, and each was ahead of its time in terms of sheer movie-making. It seems to me that "Ben-Hur" pretty much has it all, beginning with a superb story (even if you're not a Christian) and a very fine script. And then there's the acting. I'm going to hand out so many kudos here, that I feel I should begin with the one performance that was shallow and so passive as to be nearly worthless -- that of Cathy O'Donnell as Ben-Hur's sister, Tirzah. How bland can an actress get? O'Donnell answered that question definitively. No wonder this was her final film, and that after this she showed up in mostly bit parts on television. Charleton Heston is an actor that I simply can't stand any longer. I won't watch any of his films, with two exceptions: "The Ten Commandments" (because it's hard to resist the spectacle of a Cecil B. DeMille film) and "Ben-Hur". As much as I dislike the man because of his political stands, I have to admit that his acting here is absolutely superb and spot-on. His performance as a man who is constantly evolving here, is nothing short of phenomenal. Heston had a few other great performances, but this is the one that stands out and forms the basis of his legacy. We only see Jack Hawkins in on part of the film -- from the battleship to Rome -- but his performance is also right on target. Interestingly, he didn't want to do another spectacle film so soon after "Bridge On The River Kwai", which is probably a better role and performance. But he's still excellent here. Incidentally, this film was made shortly after he had gone through cobalt treatments for what eventually turned out to be throat cancer, which killed him at a relatively young age. Haya Harareet was an Israeli actress who only made 9 films in her career. Nevertheless, even aside from her beauty, this film is her finest performance, and I felt worthy of an Oscar nomination. Stephen Boyd also gave his finest performance in this film, and was just right as the selfish and spiteful antagonist. The whole controversy over whether or not he played his role as if he was a jilted gay lover spurned by Ben-Hur is an interesting one, and based on interviews with Gore Vidal. Hugh Girffith is very good as the Arab sheik. Martha Scott is not a well-remembered actress, but I always thought she was very good and very underrated. As Ben-Hur's mother here, she turns in another durable performance. Sam Jaffe is a treasure as Simonides, and this performance rivals his performance as the abbot in 1937's "Lost Horizon". I have always enjoyed Finlay Currie's performance as Balthazar in this film, and only recently have been discovering some other fine performances by the Scottish actor ("I Know Where I'm Going" and "People Will Talk"). And finally, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate is terrific. And last but not least -- the spectacle. "And a cast of thousands" is certainly true here, excellent sets (particularly for the chariot race), and of course -- that chariot race...probably film-making at its finest and most spectacular. This has it all, with few complaints. This kind of product makes Hollywood proud.

    This is one of what I call the "untouchable" movies and, along with other pieces, this is very hard to rate and review, so I usually avoid that (specially because of the usual aggression that comes from people who think high of those movies). In this case there is one particular aggravation: the quantity of Academy Awards this movie got. As we all know, this is, for many people, a measure of how good a movie is or isn't. Not seeing how much the Academy Awards is biased is, at least for me, a matter of choice (and also a lack of any sense). Being biased or not in this case, and as much as I don't want to, I feel like I should say something about this movie, so here it goes. This movie is as shallow as the ideals of those it tries to please, filled with the standard hypocrisy and bigotry you'll find in most of their minds. It's so pretensions and the acting is so hideous and corny that it's hard to believe that all of the hype around it can still exist, as you think that as time passes people would be more intelligent and critical, and would reject an abomination like this. Charlton Heston is nothing special, but he is particularly bad in this movie. This is a movie that was made to be BIG, and this is where everything revolves for it. It's an epic movie, with an epic number of extras, an epic spending on costumes and setting and equipment and an epic (debatable) soundtrack, which was specifically designed to snatch Oscars. However, from the story to the character development, this is incredibly inferior to many other epics of that time that are much more historically accurate than Ben-Hur and much better executed, with better acting and with more solid plots. The film considers itself to be not only an epic "historical" account, but also thinks it has a deeper meaning. It relies heavily on an appeal to some values, while it tries to develop in the background a story of love, friendship and revenge. It fails miserably in all of those aspects. It fails to convey a meaningful message because its values are devoid of any deepness and usually end up in contradictions. Thus, all of the actions that happen in the movie that are supposed to be linked with these values become meaningless: the conflict of the urge for revenge, etc. The childish notions of love and goodness that it conveys end up spoiling the movie, because this was clearly made for (and to impress.. and sorry for the bluntness).... Christians. It ends up being like a big Sunday school, with artsy cameos by JC himself (in the distance, or off screen, and never showing his face because, you know, it's more artsy that way, and it's also deep, like the "message" of this movie). Some religiosity in movies won't bother you that much, but this one just overdo it, and shows that this was clearly devised for Christian audiences. However, it also fails in the underlining story of Ben-Hur. His love and friendship relationships do not convince, maybe because of Academy Award winner Charlton Heston's (his performance in SOYLENT GREEN is better than this one, seriously) performance, but probably because of the poor development of the characters, which the movie clearly sacrifices to try and push its values to the audience. The costumes, the editing, everything is incredible (except the acting and the plot), and also the infamous chariot race is very well executed, so even if this movie is very slow paced it's still watchable. However, it's dull, with an acting that is hard on the eyes, and very pretentious for a movie with values so shallow and devoid of meaning. Rating: 6,5/10 (I round ratings down)

    One of the greatest Hollywood epics of all time, the first film ever to win the record amount of 11 Academy Awards, most of them well deserved. Charlton Heston stars as the Jewish nobleman Judah Ben-Hur, who finds out his once close friendship with the young Roman aristocrat Messala (Stephen Boyd) has succumbed to his strict duties as a Roman officer. This new distrust between them soon turns to hatred when, after an accident that leaves the new Roman governor of Judea wounded, Messala condemns Judah to the galleys as a slave and sends his family to the dungeons. However, Judah survives his ordeal, fueled by his hate, and in a grandiose naval battle between the Roman fleet and pirates, rescues the life of Roman Consul Arrius (Jack Hawkins), after which he is redeemed by the Emperor, adopted by Arrius and embarks on a star career as a charioteer before returning to Judea to seek vengeance on Messala in the sands of the most famous chariot race in film history. However, winning the race and fatally crippling his adversary in the process does not return his family or his happiness, things only Christ can give him on the Cross. For the majority of modern day viewers, the overt Christian overtones in the final third of the movie  the film is subtitled 'a Tale of the Christ after all  are hard to bear in their cheesiness, but this movie remains a solid undying classic in every other respect (with extra credit going to the great CinemaScope cinematography, the wonderful, catchy music and the excellent production design): the fabulous naval battle and the highly exciting chariot race remain unsurpassed.

    Well, 11 Oscras is not a mere trifle to forget about, but then, there are films that do not age well. Ben-Hur is of that caste, no matter what aficionados would say in anger. I watched it again and again very carefully to get the mood and see how well it speaks to us now. What do we have? The sub-title for the movie stated The Life Of The Christ - yes, Heis there, but this movie is not about Him and is not a Chrisitan movie. Wyler made a very typical grand scheme Hollywood blockbuster that impresses to some degree. Yes, but then, the glaring minuses speak up - 1. The film is tediously overlong, the absolutely unnecessary Prologue and Entr'Acte only kill time. 2. The blatantly obvious poorly painted backstage serving as a city or a valley look laughingly now, and obviously too cheap. 3. The play of main actors is not so deep, too. Overwrought and overblown emotions fit a theater stage more, here they look a bit funny, where it was not to be so. 4. Two most famous scenes - ship battle and horse ride are very long, too, and lack tension. They are well done, yes, but now they pale into banality. 5. The overall sentimental element is too much, too present, too loud that the whole epic dives into a syrupy melodrama. Well, this is a fine time-piece but that is all

    I recently watched this movie again after not seeing it for many years. It was a history lesson in a way, showing the brutality of the Romans, conflict between Rome and nearby nations, a chariot race, and well-known characters from the era (such as Pontius Pilate and Jesus). The action scenes are quite interesting, especially the chariot race - Remember that it wasn't as easy to do these back when the movie was made (no CGI during the 1950's). There are also a lot of themes in the movie (such as love, hate, death, healing, sadness, joy). The movie is long (more than 3 hours), and there are moments without much action, but I never felt bored while watching it. The movie is best appreciated by someone who knows about ancient Rome and Judea, and their culture (if you don't know any of this information the movie will be difficult to understand).

    There hasn't been a classic like the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur in so many years. Charleston Heston is at his best in this epic tale set in ancient Rome, of a man who faces the most dire of hardships for love and honor. It's a story of faith tested. How power can be used for corruption or for mankind's ultimate salvation! If they did a new remake of this film, I don't know if any actor could top this classic star. But with today's effects, I can't imagine how amazing this tale could be. I personally would love to do a remake. Hmm, what actor do you think might do a great remake? My picks might be; Christian Bale, Matt Bomer, Christian Cooke, Devon Sawa or Peter Facinelli for the lead role of Judah Ben-Hur. For the role of Quintus Arrius, Ben-Hur's rival, my picks might be; Ryan Gosling, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Sean Faris or Dave Annable. And for the role of Esther, my picks might be; Mila Kunis, Megan Fox, Lily James, Gal Gadot or Monica Raymund. If you love the classics and stories set in ancient Rome, this is a must see!!!

    Magnificent scenes, moving plot and excellent performances,everything is great! I like it! I once chose the film as the reference of thesis for an elective of my college. Because we could learn a lot of knowledge on the arrangement and design from the scenes of the movie. The 80s would not probably accept this film , I heard a lot of friends said: "The movie was okay!" However, I would think though it up to 4 hours, but it gives you a Open-minded feeling of the epic. And it also helped we to understand what was the artistic aesthetic then. Taken in 1959, era without computer special effects, but the picture is definitely a sense of the 21st century. Likewise the Roman theme, four decades later, even "Gladiator" with a lot of computer effects could not be compared to it.

    Uh. Sorry, folks. I know that Ben-Hur is considered by many to be an all-time classic, and everything, but, hey, aside from the chariot race (which was magnificently done), this dry-as-dust picture pushed the boundaries of monotony just a little too far for this reviewer with its 3.5 hour running time.... Yeah. It sure did. And, believe it or not, I actually sat through Ben-Hur's 3.5 hours of one over-long, dragged out scene after another and waited, and waited, and waited (ho-hum!) for something, anything worthwhile to take place, but it just didn't happen.... Nope. It didn't. (except, of course, for the chariot race) Ben-Hur was a literal biblical soap opera of epic proportions that seriously cried out for some major editing. At least a good hour could have easily been cut out of its story and I'm sure that no one would have ever noticed the diff, one way or the other. Maybe back in 1959 this film's fabricated magic might have worked on its audience like a mesmerizing spell, but that isn't the case today. No way. Considering that this film's tag-line is "A Tale of the Christ", Ben-Hur has got to be one of the most hollow and cheesy biblical stories ever captured on film. About the only memorable scene that the Christ character happened to appear in was when he was carrying his cross (or trying to) on his way to his own crucifixion - And he kept falling down - So someone had to give him a hand with carrying the thing. ( No. Not very impressive, if you ask me) Personally, I think that Ben-Hur was completely unworthy of winning a total of 11 Oscars. Particularly for its win for "Best Picture" (it was up against Anatomy For A Murder and The Diary Of Anne Frank) - And, especially, for "Best Actor", which went to that big phony-baloney with the whitest teeth, and brightest smile, Charlton Heston (who was up against James Stewart and Jack Lemmon). Yep. It was quite plain to see that everything about Ben-Hur said "expensive" (its budget was $16 million), but nothing about it was in the least bit inspirational. In spite of its big-name cast, and hordes-upon-hordes of extras, and all of its eye-popping sets and big-dollar production values, Ben-Hur was a small and petty and frivolous motion picture in so many, many ways.

    This is excellent for what it is, but what is it? Some will say it is an exciting blockbuster, others a Greek tragedy or heroic epic, or even cinematic opera with its focus on riveting but stagy drama and lush, harmonious cinemascope. It is of course all those things woven in one. The story is the same archetypal journey since Ulysses and Mahabharatathe hero is torn in the waking world of logical opposites, good and evil, duty to country against friendship and ambition, defeated with the divine trickery of a loose tile, thrust into hell to suffer oaring for some time, from where he emerges as a 'son' in splendid white clothes, and revitalized returns home to claim victory and love. That is the standard reading anyway such as you'd see in those screen writing guidebooks, not much interesting. It is at the same time a 'tale of the Christ', and this is a bit more fruitful in its spiritual dimension; the film does not end with material victory over the hated opponent, there is no peace to be found there. The idea is that the hero is properly a man when he learns to let go, forgive and accept transience. In this context, the journey is one of self realization not world redemption. You will see this with some clarity when Ben-Hur symbolically visits his mother and sister in some horrible underworld, but he realizes he cannot see them and only listens as they wish him well. Parting from there, he chances upon the Sermon on the Mountone of the three Magi of Bethlehem is there, a mentor who reveals that 'the child is now a man' (he is talking about Jesus) and we know this also applies on a second level to the protagonist. But he won't listen, being perhaps too proud or harried to sit and reflect, which only prolongs his torment for a while more, that is until he realizes who the rabbi is and follows the passions from up close. Oh the presentation is archaic and sermonizing, which is to say from the outside, symbolically presenting reflection but not making it the fabric so that you reflect. What is of more interest to me is noting this bit on the cinematic dimension: the contrast between a placid theatricality in the Jesus portions, with some exciting perspectives in the ship and chariot race segments which captivate the eye. The first is impersonal and removed from experience, imparting the awe of spectacle but not the spiritual essence, you will see for instance Calvary Hill as a stage in the distance. The latter exhibit a dynamism and placement of the eye inside the swirl of life, for instance the subjective shots of rowers looking out at the battle from ports in the hull of the galley or the powerful shots of dashing chariots as they hurl through the racetrack. There's cinematic energy here that sweeps you into what it is, instead of making you a spectator of opera. What is interesting is that the filmmaker, the very talented Wyler, had the immersive means but rested his hand outside the action.

    This is one of what I call the "untouchable" movies and, along with other pieces, this is very hard to rate and review, so I usually avoid that (specially because of the usual aggression that comes from people who think high of those movies). In this case there is one particular aggravation: the quantity of Academy Awards this movie got. As we all know, this is, for many people, a measure of how good a movie is or isn't. Not seeing how much the Academy Awards is biased is, at least for me, a matter of choice (and also a lack of any sense). Being biased or not in this case, and as much as I don't want to, I feel like I should say something about this movie, so here it goes. This movie is as shallow as the ideals of those it tries to please, filled with the standard hypocrisy and bigotry you'll find in most of their minds. It's so pretensions and the acting is so hideous and corny that it's hard to believe that all of the hype around it can still exist, as you think that as time passes people would be more intelligent and critical, and would reject an abomination like this. Charlton Heston is nothing special, but he is particularly bad in this movie. This is a movie that was made to be BIG, and this is where everything revolves for it. It's an epic movie, with an epic number of extras, an epic spending on costumes and setting and equipment and an epic (debatable) soundtrack, which was specifically designed to snatch Oscars. However, from the story to the character development, this is incredibly inferior to many other epics of that time that are much more historically accurate than Ben-Hur and much better executed, with better acting and with more solid plots. The film considers itself to be not only an epic "historical" account, but also thinks it has a deeper meaning. It relies heavily on an appeal to some values, while it tries to develop in the background a story of love, friendship and revenge. It fails miserably in all of those aspects. It fails to convey a meaningful message because its values are devoid of any deepness and usually end up in contradictions. Thus, all of the actions that happen in the movie that are supposed to be linked with these values become meaningless: the conflict of the urge for revenge, etc. The childish notions of love and goodness that it conveys end up spoiling the movie, because this was clearly made for (and to impress.. and sorry for the bluntness).... Christians. It ends up being like a big Sunday school, with artsy cameos by JC himself (in the distance, or off screen, and never showing his face because, you know, it's more artsy that way, and it's also deep, like the "message" of this movie). Some religiosity in movies won't bother you that much, but this one just overdo it, and shows that this was clearly devised for Christian audiences. However, it also fails in the underlining story of Ben-Hur. His love and friendship relationships do not convince, maybe because of Academy Award winner Charlton Heston's (his performance in SOYLENT GREEN is better than this one, seriously) performance, but probably because of the poor development of the characters, which the movie clearly sacrifices to try and push its values to the audience. The costumes, the editing, everything is incredible (except the acting and the plot), and also the infamous chariot race is very well executed, so even if this movie is very slow paced it's still watchable. However, it's dull, with an acting that is hard on the eyes, and very pretentious for a movie with values so shallow and devoid of meaning. Rating: 6,5/10 (I round ratings down)

    One of the greatest Hollywood epics of all time, the first film ever to win the record amount of 11 Academy Awards, most of them well deserved. Charlton Heston stars as the Jewish nobleman Judah Ben-Hur, who finds out his once close friendship with the young Roman aristocrat Messala (Stephen Boyd) has succumbed to his strict duties as a Roman officer. This new distrust between them soon turns to hatred when, after an accident that leaves the new Roman governor of Judea wounded, Messala condemns Judah to the galleys as a slave and sends his family to the dungeons. However, Judah survives his ordeal, fueled by his hate, and in a grandiose naval battle between the Roman fleet and pirates, rescues the life of Roman Consul Arrius (Jack Hawkins), after which he is redeemed by the Emperor, adopted by Arrius and embarks on a star career as a charioteer before returning to Judea to seek vengeance on Messala in the sands of the most famous chariot race in film history. However, winning the race and fatally crippling his adversary in the process does not return his family or his happiness, things only Christ can give him on the Cross. For the majority of modern day viewers, the overt Christian overtones in the final third of the movie  the film is subtitled 'a Tale of the Christ after all  are hard to bear in their cheesiness, but this movie remains a solid undying classic in every other respect (with extra credit going to the great CinemaScope cinematography, the wonderful, catchy music and the excellent production design): the fabulous naval battle and the highly exciting chariot race remain unsurpassed.

    Well, 11 Oscras is not a mere trifle to forget about, but then, there are films that do not age well. Ben-Hur is of that caste, no matter what aficionados would say in anger. I watched it again and again very carefully to get the mood and see how well it speaks to us now. What do we have? The sub-title for the movie stated The Life Of The Christ - yes, Heis there, but this movie is not about Him and is not a Chrisitan movie. Wyler made a very typical grand scheme Hollywood blockbuster that impresses to some degree. Yes, but then, the glaring minuses speak up - 1. The film is tediously overlong, the absolutely unnecessary Prologue and Entr'Acte only kill time. 2. The blatantly obvious poorly painted backstage serving as a city or a valley look laughingly now, and obviously too cheap. 3. The play of main actors is not so deep, too. Overwrought and overblown emotions fit a theater stage more, here they look a bit funny, where it was not to be so. 4. Two most famous scenes - ship battle and horse ride are very long, too, and lack tension. They are well done, yes, but now they pale into banality. 5. The overall sentimental element is too much, too present, too loud that the whole epic dives into a syrupy melodrama. Well, this is a fine time-piece but that is all

    I recently watched this movie again after not seeing it for many years. It was a history lesson in a way, showing the brutality of the Romans, conflict between Rome and nearby nations, a chariot race, and well-known characters from the era (such as Pontius Pilate and Jesus). The action scenes are quite interesting, especially the chariot race - Remember that it wasn't as easy to do these back when the movie was made (no CGI during the 1950's). There are also a lot of themes in the movie (such as love, hate, death, healing, sadness, joy). The movie is long (more than 3 hours), and there are moments without much action, but I never felt bored while watching it. The movie is best appreciated by someone who knows about ancient Rome and Judea, and their culture (if you don't know any of this information the movie will be difficult to understand).

    There hasn't been a classic like the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur in so many years. Charleston Heston is at his best in this epic tale set in ancient Rome, of a man who faces the most dire of hardships for love and honor. It's a story of faith tested. How power can be used for corruption or for mankind's ultimate salvation! If they did a new remake of this film, I don't know if any actor could top this classic star. But with today's effects, I can't imagine how amazing this tale could be. I personally would love to do a remake. Hmm, what actor do you think might do a great remake? My picks might be; Christian Bale, Matt Bomer, Christian Cooke, Devon Sawa or Peter Facinelli for the lead role of Judah Ben-Hur. For the role of Quintus Arrius, Ben-Hur's rival, my picks might be; Ryan Gosling, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Sean Faris or Dave Annable. And for the role of Esther, my picks might be; Mila Kunis, Megan Fox, Lily James, Gal Gadot or Monica Raymund. If you love the classics and stories set in ancient Rome, this is a must see!!!

    Magnificent scenes, moving plot and excellent performances,everything is great! I like it! I once chose the film as the reference of thesis for an elective of my college. Because we could learn a lot of knowledge on the arrangement and design from the scenes of the movie. The 80s would not probably accept this film , I heard a lot of friends said: "The movie was okay!" However, I would think though it up to 4 hours, but it gives you a Open-minded feeling of the epic. And it also helped we to understand what was the artistic aesthetic then. Taken in 1959, era without computer special effects, but the picture is definitely a sense of the 21st century. Likewise the Roman theme, four decades later, even "Gladiator" with a lot of computer effects could not be compared to it.

    Uh. Sorry, folks. I know that Ben-Hur is considered by many to be an all-time classic, and everything, but, hey, aside from the chariot race (which was magnificently done), this dry-as-dust picture pushed the boundaries of monotony just a little too far for this reviewer with its 3.5 hour running time.... Yeah. It sure did. And, believe it or not, I actually sat through Ben-Hur's 3.5 hours of one over-long, dragged out scene after another and waited, and waited, and waited (ho-hum!) for something, anything worthwhile to take place, but it just didn't happen.... Nope. It didn't. (except, of course, for the chariot race) Ben-Hur was a literal biblical soap opera of epic proportions that seriously cried out for some major editing. At least a good hour could have easily been cut out of its story and I'm sure that no one would have ever noticed the diff, one way or the other. Maybe back in 1959 this film's fabricated magic might have worked on its audience like a mesmerizing spell, but that isn't the case today. No way. Considering that this film's tag-line is "A Tale of the Christ", Ben-Hur has got to be one of the most hollow and cheesy biblical stories ever captured on film. About the only memorable scene that the Christ character happened to appear in was when he was carrying his cross (or trying to) on his way to his own crucifixion - And he kept falling down - So someone had to give him a hand with carrying the thing. ( No. Not very impressive, if you ask me) Personally, I think that Ben-Hur was completely unworthy of winning a total of 11 Oscars. Particularly for its win for "Best Picture" (it was up against Anatomy For A Murder and The Diary Of Anne Frank) - And, especially, for "Best Actor", which went to that big phony-baloney with the whitest teeth, and brightest smile, Charlton Heston (who was up against James Stewart and Jack Lemmon). Yep. It was quite plain to see that everything about Ben-Hur said "expensive" (its budget was $16 million), but nothing about it was in the least bit inspirational. In spite of its big-name cast, and hordes-upon-hordes of extras, and all of its eye-popping sets and big-dollar production values, Ben-Hur was a small and petty and frivolous motion picture in so many, many ways.

    This is excellent for what it is, but what is it? Some will say it is an exciting blockbuster, others a Greek tragedy or heroic epic, or even cinematic opera with its focus on riveting but stagy drama and lush, harmonious cinemascope. It is of course all those things woven in one. The story is the same archetypal journey since Ulysses and Mahabharatathe hero is torn in the waking world of logical opposites, good and evil, duty to country against friendship and ambition, defeated with the divine trickery of a loose tile, thrust into hell to suffer oaring for some time, from where he emerges as a 'son' in splendid white clothes, and revitalized returns home to claim victory and love. That is the standard reading anyway such as you'd see in those screen writing guidebooks, not much interesting. It is at the same time a 'tale of the Christ', and this is a bit more fruitful in its spiritual dimension; the film does not end with material victory over the hated opponent, there is no peace to be found there. The idea is that the hero is properly a man when he learns to let go, forgive and accept transience. In this context, the journey is one of self realization not world redemption. You will see this with some clarity when Ben-Hur symbolically visits his mother and sister in some horrible underworld, but he realizes he cannot see them and only listens as they wish him well. Parting from there, he chances upon the Sermon on the Mountone of the three Magi of Bethlehem is there, a mentor who reveals that 'the child is now a man' (he is talking about Jesus) and we know this also applies on a second level to the protagonist. But he won't listen, being perhaps too proud or harried to sit and reflect, which only prolongs his torment for a while more, that is until he realizes who the rabbi is and follows the passions from up close. Oh the presentation is archaic and sermonizing, which is to say from the outside, symbolically presenting reflection but not making it the fabric so that you reflect. What is of more interest to me is noting this bit on the cinematic dimension: the contrast between a placid theatricality in the Jesus portions, with some exciting perspectives in the ship and chariot race segments which captivate the eye. The first is impersonal and removed from experience, imparting the awe of spectacle but not the spiritual essence, you will see for instance Calvary Hill as a stage in the distance. The latter exhibit a dynamism and placement of the eye inside the swirl of life, for instance the subjective shots of rowers looking out at the battle from ports in the hull of the galley or the powerful shots of dashing chariots as they hurl through the racetrack. There's cinematic energy here that sweeps you into what it is, instead of making you a spectator of opera. What is interesting is that the filmmaker, the very talented Wyler, had the immersive means but rested his hand outside the action.

    For more than 100 years, the tale of Ben Hur has staggered the imaginations of audiences worldwide, as indicated by its successful publication history, having at least three different film adaptations, and even a stage play adaptation. Of all the exposure this story has received, much of its acclaim may be attributed to its famous 1959 film adaptation, which remains a classic in epic cinema, and a standard Easter holiday favorite. Whether you've heard of Ben Hur or not, chances are good that you've seen this film referenced or mentioned somewhere in pop culture. It stands as one of the biggest, most epic, most ambitious productions in cinema to date. It's most impressive in how it employed thousands of extras, over a million props, and some very expensive and lavish setpieces to bring this larger-than-life tale to life. Even if you aren't marveling at the sheer scope and scale of this film, the chariot race in the film's final act will have you at the edge of your seat. It's a long, uncompromising, real-looking sequence that's still thrilling and intense, and it should stand as one of the best racing scenes of all time. There is a really neat sea battle in the film's first half, which offers even more thrills and violence to behold. For the most part, however, this is a film more heavily built on drama and characterization. Parts of it remain enthralling, as we watch the title character suffer and fight his way through adversity. However, in between the major turning events and the action scenes, the film's momentum does suffer a massive slump. The pacing in certain scenes never agreed with me personally, and is really the only issue I take with this fine picture. The story for this film is perfectly sound and well-built. Judah Ben Hur is a well-rounded character we can follow easily enough and relate to; his rivalry with Messala provides the conflict to drive the plot forward, and digs up some interesting themes of vengeance and hatred. What really propels the film above and beyond will be the story of Christ, running in tandem with Ben Hur's story; both story lines become entwined to reveal strong themes of redemption and salvation. I have no clue how closely this adapts Lew Wallace's original novel, but on its own merits, this film offers a decently insightful story. Captured with a sweeping widescreen frame on a pristine 70mm film stock, this film looks every bit as big as it is. Just about every shot is carefully calculated to best present the imagery with incredible amounts of detail. It uses a lot of long shots, which never felt all that intimate or interesting to me personally, but it is definitely a big-scale picture with lots of impressive shots. Acting is pleasing; Charlton Heston plays Ben Hur with enough nuance and machismo to make the character cool and memorable. The rest of the cast do their best. Writing is not too bad either. This production spares no expense on its massive sets, props, costumes, and visual effects. Music is just as big and ambitious as the rest of the movie is. For its sheer epicness and classic status, this film comes highly recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)

    I want to begin by saying that I watched this film...again...on Easter weekend, and, by coincidence, when I had just learned that MGM is planning a remake. I'm usually not a big fan of remakes, but I think in this case it will -- at the very least -- be interesting. I understand that the new script will be closer to the story as written by General Lew Wallace. Let me skip to my recent experience of watching the new Oz film...not bad...enjoyable...but knowing that virtually every scene in that movie was filmed in front of a blue/green screen kinda ruined it for me...I felt as if the actors were simply placed within a cartoon. Much as the rather over-the-top special effects in the final Indiana Jones movie ruined that for me. There's nothing wrong with special effects...they're in all films to some degree or another...but it's getting to the point where so many films focus on the special effects that we are losing the ability to judge fine acting and fine script-writing. I fear the remake of "Ben-Hur" may end of that way, also -- a special effects extravaganza that will make the new film a shadow of this classic. I mentioned that this is my second-favorite film...just behind "Gone With The Wind", and that's partly because each had a superior story, and each was ahead of its time in terms of sheer movie-making. It seems to me that "Ben-Hur" pretty much has it all, beginning with a superb story (even if you're not a Christian) and a very fine script. And then there's the acting. I'm going to hand out so many kudos here, that I feel I should begin with the one performance that was shallow and so passive as to be nearly worthless -- that of Cathy O'Donnell as Ben-Hur's sister, Tirzah. How bland can an actress get? O'Donnell answered that question definitively. No wonder this was her final film, and that after this she showed up in mostly bit parts on television. Charleton Heston is an actor that I simply can't stand any longer. I won't watch any of his films, with two exceptions: "The Ten Commandments" (because it's hard to resist the spectacle of a Cecil B. DeMille film) and "Ben-Hur". As much as I dislike the man because of his political stands, I have to admit that his acting here is absolutely superb and spot-on. His performance as a man who is constantly evolving here, is nothing short of phenomenal. Heston had a few other great performances, but this is the one that stands out and forms the basis of his legacy. We only see Jack Hawkins in on part of the film -- from the battleship to Rome -- but his performance is also right on target. Interestingly, he didn't want to do another spectacle film so soon after "Bridge On The River Kwai", which is probably a better role and performance. But he's still excellent here. Incidentally, this film was made shortly after he had gone through cobalt treatments for what eventually turned out to be throat cancer, which killed him at a relatively young age. Haya Harareet was an Israeli actress who only made 9 films in her career. Nevertheless, even aside from her beauty, this film is her finest performance, and I felt worthy of an Oscar nomination. Stephen Boyd also gave his finest performance in this film, and was just right as the selfish and spiteful antagonist. The whole controversy over whether or not he played his role as if he was a jilted gay lover spurned by Ben-Hur is an interesting one, and based on interviews with Gore Vidal. Hugh Girffith is very good as the Arab sheik. Martha Scott is not a well-remembered actress, but I always thought she was very good and very underrated. As Ben-Hur's mother here, she turns in another durable performance. Sam Jaffe is a treasure as Simonides, and this performance rivals his performance as the abbot in 1937's "Lost Horizon". I have always enjoyed Finlay Currie's performance as Balthazar in this film, and only recently have been discovering some other fine performances by the Scottish actor ("I Know Where I'm Going" and "People Will Talk"). And finally, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate is terrific. And last but not least -- the spectacle. "And a cast of thousands" is certainly true here, excellent sets (particularly for the chariot race), and of course -- that chariot race...probably film-making at its finest and most spectacular. This has it all, with few complaints. This kind of product makes Hollywood proud.

The action scenes are quite interesting, especially the chariot race - Remember that it wasn't as easy to do these back when the movie was made (no CGI during the 1950's). There are also a lot of themes in the movie (such as love, hate, death, healing, sadness, joy). The movie is long (more than 3 hours), and there are moments without much action, but I never felt bored while watching it. The movie is best appreciated by someone who knows about ancient Rome and Judea, and their culture (if you don't know any of this information the movie will be difficult to understand).

    There hasn't been a classic like the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur in so many years. Charleston Heston is at his best in this epic tale set in ancient Rome, of a man who faces the most dire of hardships for love and honor. It's a story of faith tested. How power can be used for corruption or for mankind's ultimate salvation! If they did a new remake of this film, I don't know if any actor could top this classic star. But with today's effects, I can't imagine how amazing this tale could be. I personally would love to do a remake. Hmm, what actor do you think might do a great remake? My picks might be; Christian Bale, Matt Bomer, Christian Cooke, Devon Sawa or Peter Facinelli for the lead role of Judah Ben-Hur. For the role of Quintus Arrius, Ben-Hur's rival, my picks might be; Ryan Gosling, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Sean Faris or Dave Annable. And for the role of Esther, my picks might be; Mila Kunis, Megan Fox, Lily James, Gal Gadot or Monica Raymund. If you love the classics and stories set in ancient Rome, this is a must see!!!

    Magnificent scenes, moving plot and excellent performances,everything is great! I like it! I once chose the film as the reference of thesis for an elective of my college. Because we could learn a lot of knowledge on the arrangement and design from the scenes of the movie. The 80s would not probably accept this film , I heard a lot of friends said: "The movie was okay!" However, I would think though it up to 4 hours, but it gives you a Open-minded feeling of the epic. And it also helped we to understand what was the artistic aesthetic then. Taken in 1959, era without computer special effects, but the picture is definitely a sense of the 21st century. Likewise the Roman theme, four decades later, even "Gladiator" with a lot of computer effects could not be compared to it.

    Uh. Sorry, folks. I know that Ben-Hur is considered by many to be an all-time classic, and everything, but, hey, aside from the chariot race (which was magnificently done), this dry-as-dust picture pushed the boundaries of monotony just a little too far for this reviewer with its 3.5 hour running time.... Yeah. It sure did. And, believe it or not, I actually sat through Ben-Hur's 3.5 hours of one over-long, dragged out scene after another and waited, and waited, and waited (ho-hum!) for something, anything worthwhile to take place, but it just didn't happen.... Nope. It didn't. (except, of course, for the chariot race) Ben-Hur was a literal biblical soap opera of epic proportions that seriously cried out for some major editing. At least a good hour could have easily been cut out of its story and I'm sure that no one would have ever noticed the diff, one way or the other. Maybe back in 1959 this film's fabricated magic might have worked on its audience like a mesmerizing spell, but that isn't the case today. No way. Considering that this film's tag-line is "A Tale of the Christ", Ben-Hur has got to be one of the most hollow and cheesy biblical stories ever captured on film. About the only memorable scene that the Christ character happened to appear in was when he was carrying his cross (or trying to) on his way to his own crucifixion - And he kept falling down - So someone had to give him a hand with carrying the thing. ( No. Not very impressive, if you ask me) Personally, I think that Ben-Hur was completely unworthy of winning a total of 11 Oscars. Particularly for its win for "Best Picture" (it was up against Anatomy For A Murder and The Diary Of Anne Frank) - And, especially, for "Best Actor", which went to that big phony-baloney with the whitest teeth, and brightest smile, Charlton Heston (who was up against James Stewart and Jack Lemmon). Yep. It was quite plain to see that everything about Ben-Hur said "expensive" (its budget was $16 million), but nothing about it was in the least bit inspirational. In spite of its big-name cast, and hordes-upon-hordes of extras, and all of its eye-popping sets and big-dollar production values, Ben-Hur was a small and petty and frivolous motion picture in so many, many ways.

    This is excellent for what it is, but what is it? Some will say it is an exciting blockbuster, others a Greek tragedy or heroic epic, or even cinematic opera with its focus on riveting but stagy drama and lush, harmonious cinemascope. It is of course all those things woven in one. The story is the same archetypal journey since Ulysses and Mahabharatathe hero is torn in the waking world of logical opposites, good and evil, duty to country against friendship and ambition, defeated with the divine trickery of a loose tile, thrust into hell to suffer oaring for some time, from where he emerges as a 'son' in splendid white clothes, and revitalized returns home to claim victory and love. That is the standard reading anyway such as you'd see in those screen writing guidebooks, not much interesting. It is at the same time a 'tale of the Christ', and this is a bit more fruitful in its spiritual dimension; the film does not end with material victory over the hated opponent, there is no peace to be found there. The idea is that the hero is properly a man when he learns to let go, forgive and accept transience. In this context, the journey is one of self realization not world redemption. You will see this with some clarity when Ben-Hur symbolically visits his mother and sister in some horrible underworld, but he realizes he cannot see them and only listens as they wish him well. Parting from there, he chances upon the Sermon on the Mountone of the three Magi of Bethlehem is there, a mentor who reveals that 'the child is now a man' (he is talking about Jesus) and we know this also applies on a second level to the protagonist. But he won't listen, being perhaps too proud or harried to sit and reflect, which only prolongs his torment for a while more, that is until he realizes who the rabbi is and follows the passions from up close. Oh the presentation is archaic and sermonizing, which is to say from the outside, symbolically presenting reflection but not making it the fabric so that you reflect. What is of more interest to me is noting this bit on the cinematic dimension: the contrast between a placid theatricality in the Jesus portions, with some exciting perspectives in the ship and chariot race segments which captivate the eye. The first is impersonal and removed from experience, imparting the awe of spectacle but not the spiritual essence, you will see for instance Calvary Hill as a stage in the distance. The latter exhibit a dynamism and placement of the eye inside the swirl of life, for instance the subjective shots of rowers looking out at the battle from ports in the hull of the galley or the powerful shots of dashing chariots as they hurl through the racetrack. There's cinematic energy here that sweeps you into what it is, instead of making you a spectator of opera. What is interesting is that the filmmaker, the very talented Wyler, had the immersive means but rested his hand outside the action.

    For more than 100 years, the tale of Ben Hur has staggered the imaginations of audiences worldwide, as indicated by its successful publication history, having at least three different film adaptations, and even a stage play adaptation. Of all the exposure this story has received, much of its acclaim may be attributed to its famous 1959 film adaptation, which remains a classic in epic cinema, and a standard Easter holiday favorite. Whether you've heard of Ben Hur or not, chances are good that you've seen this film referenced or mentioned somewhere in pop culture. It stands as one of the biggest, most epic, most ambitious productions in cinema to date. It's most impressive in how it employed thousands of extras, over a million props, and some very expensive and lavish setpieces to bring this larger-than-life tale to life. Even if you aren't marveling at the sheer scope and scale of this film, the chariot race in the film's final act will have you at the edge of your seat. It's a long, uncompromising, real-looking sequence that's still thrilling and intense, and it should stand as one of the best racing scenes of all time. There is a really neat sea battle in the film's first half, which offers even more thrills and violence to behold. For the most part, however, this is a film more heavily built on drama and characterization. Parts of it remain enthralling, as we watch the title character suffer and fight his way through adversity. However, in between the major turning events and the action scenes, the film's momentum does suffer a massive slump. The pacing in certain scenes never agreed with me personally, and is really the only issue I take with this fine picture. The story for this film is perfectly sound and well-built. Judah Ben Hur is a well-rounded character we can follow easily enough and relate to; his rivalry with Messala provides the conflict to drive the plot forward, and digs up some interesting themes of vengeance and hatred. What really propels the film above and beyond will be the story of Christ, running in tandem with Ben Hur's story; both story lines become entwined to reveal strong themes of redemption and salvation. I have no clue how closely this adapts Lew Wallace's original novel, but on its own merits, this film offers a decently insightful story. Captured with a sweeping widescreen frame on a pristine 70mm film stock, this film looks every bit as big as it is. Just about every shot is carefully calculated to best present the imagery with incredible amounts of detail. It uses a lot of long shots, which never felt all that intimate or interesting to me personally, but it is definitely a big-scale picture with lots of impressive shots. Acting is pleasing; Charlton Heston plays Ben Hur with enough nuance and machismo to make the character cool and memorable. The rest of the cast do their best. Writing is not too bad either. This production spares no expense on its massive sets, props, costumes, and visual effects. Music is just as big and ambitious as the rest of the movie is. For its sheer epicness and classic status, this film comes highly recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)

    I want to begin by saying that I watched this film...again...on Easter weekend, and, by coincidence, when I had just learned that MGM is planning a remake. I'm usually not a big fan of remakes, but I think in this case it will -- at the very least -- be interesting. I understand that the new script will be closer to the story as written by General Lew Wallace. Let me skip to my recent experience of watching the new Oz film...not bad...enjoyable...but knowing that virtually every scene in that movie was filmed in front of a blue/green screen kinda ruined it for me...I felt as if the actors were simply placed within a cartoon. Much as the rather over-the-top special effects in the final Indiana Jones movie ruined that for me. There's nothing wrong with special effects...they're in all films to some degree or another...but it's getting to the point where so many films focus on the special effects that we are losing the ability to judge fine acting and fine script-writing. I fear the remake of "Ben-Hur" may end of that way, also -- a special effects extravaganza that will make the new film a shadow of this classic. I mentioned that this is my second-favorite film...just behind "Gone With The Wind", and that's partly because each had a superior story, and each was ahead of its time in terms of sheer movie-making. It seems to me that "Ben-Hur" pretty much has it all, beginning with a superb story (even if you're not a Christian) and a very fine script. And then there's the acting. I'm going to hand out so many kudos here, that I feel I should begin with the one performance that was shallow and so passive as to be nearly worthless -- that of Cathy O'Donnell as Ben-Hur's sister, Tirzah. How bland can an actress get? O'Donnell answered that question definitively. No wonder this was her final film, and that after this she showed up in mostly bit parts on television. Charleton Heston is an actor that I simply can't stand any longer. I won't watch any of his films, with two exceptions: "The Ten Commandments" (because it's hard to resist the spectacle of a Cecil B. DeMille film) and "Ben-Hur". As much as I dislike the man because of his political stands, I have to admit that his acting here is absolutely superb and spot-on. His performance as a man who is constantly evolving here, is nothing short of phenomenal. Heston had a few other great performances, but this is the one that stands out and forms the basis of his legacy. We only see Jack Hawkins in on part of the film -- from the battleship to Rome -- but his performance is also right on target. Interestingly, he didn't want to do another spectacle film so soon after "Bridge On The River Kwai", which is probably a better role and performance. But he's still excellent here. Incidentally, this film was made shortly after he had gone through cobalt treatments for what eventually turned out to be throat cancer, which killed him at a relatively young age. Haya Harareet was an Israeli actress who only made 9 films in her career. Nevertheless, even aside from her beauty, this film is her finest performance, and I felt worthy of an Oscar nomination. Stephen Boyd also gave his finest performance in this film, and was just right as the selfish and spiteful antagonist. The whole controversy over whether or not he played his role as if he was a jilted gay lover spurned by Ben-Hur is an interesting one, and based on interviews with Gore Vidal. Hugh Girffith is very good as the Arab sheik. Martha Scott is not a well-remembered actress, but I always thought she was very good and very underrated. As Ben-Hur's mother here, she turns in another durable performance. Sam Jaffe is a treasure as Simonides, and this performance rivals his performance as the abbot in 1937's "Lost Horizon". I have always enjoyed Finlay Currie's performance as Balthazar in this film, and only recently have been discovering some other fine performances by the Scottish actor ("I Know Where I'm Going" and "People Will Talk"). And finally, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate is terrific. And last but not least -- the spectacle. "And a cast of thousands" is certainly true here, excellent sets (particularly for the chariot race), and of course -- that chariot race...probably film-making at its finest and most spectacular. This has it all, with few complaints. This kind of product makes Hollywood proud.

    This is one of what I call the "untouchable" movies and, along with other pieces, this is very hard to rate and review, so I usually avoid that (specially because of the usual aggression that comes from people who think high of those movies). In this case there is one particular aggravation: the quantity of Academy Awards this movie got. As we all know, this is, for many people, a measure of how good a movie is or isn't. Not seeing how much the Academy Awards is biased is, at least for me, a matter of choice (and also a lack of any sense). Being biased or not in this case, and as much as I don't want to, I feel like I should say something about this movie, so here it goes. This movie is as shallow as the ideals of those it tries to please, filled with the standard hypocrisy and bigotry you'll find in most of their minds. It's so pretensions and the acting is so hideous and corny that it's hard to believe that all of the hype around it can still exist, as you think that as time passes people would be more intelligent and critical, and would reject an abomination like this. Charlton Heston is nothing special, but he is particularly bad in this movie. This is a movie that was made to be BIG, and this is where everything revolves for it. It's an epic movie, with an epic number of extras, an epic spending on costumes and setting and equipment and an epic (debatable) soundtrack, which was specifically designed to snatch Oscars. However, from the story to the character development, this is incredibly inferior to many other epics of that time that are much more historically accurate than Ben-Hur and much better executed, with better acting and with more solid plots. The film considers itself to be not only an epic "historical" account, but also thinks it has a deeper meaning. It relies heavily on an appeal to some values, while it tries to develop in the background a story of love, friendship and revenge. It fails miserably in all of those aspects. It fails to convey a meaningful message because its values are devoid of any deepness and usually end up in contradictions. Thus, all of the actions that happen in the movie that are supposed to be linked with these values become meaningless: the conflict of the urge for revenge, etc. The childish notions of love and goodness that it conveys end up spoiling the movie, because this was clearly made for (and to impress.. and sorry for the bluntness).... Christians. It ends up being like a big Sunday school, with artsy cameos by JC himself (in the distance, or off screen, and never showing his face because, you know, it's more artsy that way, and it's also deep, like the "message" of this movie). Some religiosity in movies won't bother you that much, but this one just overdo it, and shows that this was clearly devised for Christian audiences. However, it also fails in the underlining story of Ben-Hur. His love and friendship relationships do not convince, maybe because of Academy Award winner Charlton Heston's (his performance in SOYLENT GREEN is better than this one, seriously) performance, but probably because of the poor development of the characters, which the movie clearly sacrifices to try and push its values to the audience. The costumes, the editing, everything is incredible (except the acting and the plot), and also the infamous chariot race is very well executed, so even if this movie is very slow paced it's still watchable. However, it's dull, with an acting that is hard on the eyes, and very pretentious for a movie with values so shallow and devoid of meaning. Rating: 6,5/10 (I round ratings down)

    One of the greatest Hollywood epics of all time, the first film ever to win the record amount of 11 Academy Awards, most of them well deserved. Charlton Heston stars as the Jewish nobleman Judah Ben-Hur, who finds out his once close friendship with the young Roman aristocrat Messala (Stephen Boyd) has succumbed to his strict duties as a Roman officer. This new distrust between them soon turns to hatred when, after an accident that leaves the new Roman governor of Judea wounded, Messala condemns Judah to the galleys as a slave and sends his family to the dungeons. However, Judah survives his ordeal, fueled by his hate, and in a grandiose naval battle between the Roman fleet and pirates, rescues the life of Roman Consul Arrius (Jack Hawkins), after which he is redeemed by the Emperor, adopted by Arrius and embarks on a star career as a charioteer before returning to Judea to seek vengeance on Messala in the sands of the most famous chariot race in film history. However, winning the race and fatally crippling his adversary in the process does not return his family or his happiness, things only Christ can give him on the Cross. For the majority of modern day viewers, the overt Christian overtones in the final third of the movie  the film is subtitled 'a Tale of the Christ after all  are hard to bear in their cheesiness, but this movie remains a solid undying classic in every other respect (with extra credit going to the great CinemaScope cinematography, the wonderful, catchy music and the excellent production design): the fabulous naval battle and the highly exciting chariot race remain unsurpassed.

    Well, 11 Oscras is not a mere trifle to forget about, but then, there are films that do not age well. Ben-Hur is of that caste, no matter what aficionados would say in anger. I watched it again and again very carefully to get the mood and see how well it speaks to us now. What do we have? The sub-title for the movie stated The Life Of The Christ - yes, Heis there, but this movie is not about Him and is not a Chrisitan movie. Wyler made a very typical grand scheme Hollywood blockbuster that impresses to some degree. Yes, but then, the glaring minuses speak up - 1. The film is tediously overlong, the absolutely unnecessary Prologue and Entr'Acte only kill time. 2. The blatantly obvious poorly painted backstage serving as a city or a valley look laughingly now, and obviously too cheap. 3. The play of main actors is not so deep, too. Overwrought and overblown emotions fit a theater stage more, here they look a bit funny, where it was not to be so. 4. Two most famous scenes - ship battle and horse ride are very long, too, and lack tension. They are well done, yes, but now they pale into banality. 5. The overall sentimental element is too much, too present, too loud that the whole epic dives into a syrupy melodrama. Well, this is a fine time-piece but that is all

Parting from there, he chances upon the Sermon on the Mountone of the three Magi of Bethlehem is there, a mentor who reveals that 'the child is now a man' (he is talking about Jesus) and we know this also applies on a second level to the protagonist. But he won't listen, being perhaps too proud or harried to sit and reflect, which only prolongs his torment for a while more, that is until he realizes who the rabbi is and follows the passions from up close. Oh the presentation is archaic and sermonizing, which is to say from the outside, symbolically presenting reflection but not making it the fabric so that you reflect. What is of more interest to me is noting this bit on the cinematic dimension: the contrast between a placid theatricality in the Jesus portions, with some exciting perspectives in the ship and chariot race segments which captivate the eye. The first is impersonal and removed from experience, imparting the awe of spectacle but not the spiritual essence, you will see for instance Calvary Hill as a stage in the distance. The latter exhibit a dynamism and placement of the eye inside the swirl of life, for instance the subjective shots of rowers looking out at the battle from ports in the hull of the galley or the powerful shots of dashing chariots as they hurl through the racetrack. There's cinematic energy here that sweeps you into what it is, instead of making you a spectator of opera. What is interesting is that the filmmaker, the very talented Wyler, had the immersive means but rested his hand outside the action.

    For more than 100 years, the tale of Ben Hur has staggered the imaginations of audiences worldwide, as indicated by its successful publication history, having at least three different film adaptations, and even a stage play adaptation. Of all the exposure this story has received, much of its acclaim may be attributed to its famous 1959 film adaptation, which remains a classic in epic cinema, and a standard Easter holiday favorite. Whether you've heard of Ben Hur or not, chances are good that you've seen this film referenced or mentioned somewhere in pop culture. It stands as one of the biggest, most epic, most ambitious productions in cinema to date. It's most impressive in how it employed thousands of extras, over a million props, and some very expensive and lavish setpieces to bring this larger-than-life tale to life. Even if you aren't marveling at the sheer scope and scale of this film, the chariot race in the film's final act will have you at the edge of your seat. It's a long, uncompromising, real-looking sequence that's still thrilling and intense, and it should stand as one of the best racing scenes of all time. There is a really neat sea battle in the film's first half, which offers even more thrills and violence to behold. For the most part, however, this is a film more heavily built on drama and characterization. Parts of it remain enthralling, as we watch the title character suffer and fight his way through adversity. However, in between the major turning events and the action scenes, the film's momentum does suffer a massive slump. The pacing in certain scenes never agreed with me personally, and is really the only issue I take with this fine picture. The story for this film is perfectly sound and well-built. Judah Ben Hur is a well-rounded character we can follow easily enough and relate to; his rivalry with Messala provides the conflict to drive the plot forward, and digs up some interesting themes of vengeance and hatred. What really propels the film above and beyond will be the story of Christ, running in tandem with Ben Hur's story; both story lines become entwined to reveal strong themes of redemption and salvation. I have no clue how closely this adapts Lew Wallace's original novel, but on its own merits, this film offers a decently insightful story. Captured with a sweeping widescreen frame on a pristine 70mm film stock, this film looks every bit as big as it is. Just about every shot is carefully calculated to best present the imagery with incredible amounts of detail. It uses a lot of long shots, which never felt all that intimate or interesting to me personally, but it is definitely a big-scale picture with lots of impressive shots. Acting is pleasing; Charlton Heston plays Ben Hur with enough nuance and machismo to make the character cool and memorable. The rest of the cast do their best. Writing is not too bad either. This production spares no expense on its massive sets, props, costumes, and visual effects. Music is just as big and ambitious as the rest of the movie is. For its sheer epicness and classic status, this film comes highly recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)

    I want to begin by saying that I watched this film...again...on Easter weekend, and, by coincidence, when I had just learned that MGM is planning a remake. I'm usually not a big fan of remakes, but I think in this case it will -- at the very least -- be interesting. I understand that the new script will be closer to the story as written by General Lew Wallace. Let me skip to my recent experience of watching the new Oz film...not bad...enjoyable...but knowing that virtually every scene in that movie was filmed in front of a blue/green screen kinda ruined it for me...I felt as if the actors were simply placed within a cartoon. Much as the rather over-the-top special effects in the final Indiana Jones movie ruined that for me. There's nothing wrong with special effects...they're in all films to some degree or another...but it's getting to the point where so many films focus on the special effects that we are losing the ability to judge fine acting and fine script-writing. I fear the remake of "Ben-Hur" may end of that way, also -- a special effects extravaganza that will make the new film a shadow of this classic. I mentioned that this is my second-favorite film...just behind "Gone With The Wind", and that's partly because each had a superior story, and each was ahead of its time in terms of sheer movie-making. It seems to me that "Ben-Hur" pretty much has it all, beginning with a superb story (even if you're not a Christian) and a very fine script. And then there's the acting. I'm going to hand out so many kudos here, that I feel I should begin with the one performance that was shallow and so passive as to be nearly worthless -- that of Cathy O'Donnell as Ben-Hur's sister, Tirzah. How bland can an actress get? O'Donnell answered that question definitively. No wonder this was her final film, and that after this she showed up in mostly bit parts on television. Charleton Heston is an actor that I simply can't stand any longer. I won't watch any of his films, with two exceptions: "The Ten Commandments" (because it's hard to resist the spectacle of a Cecil B. DeMille film) and "Ben-Hur". As much as I dislike the man because of his political stands, I have to admit that his acting here is absolutely superb and spot-on. His performance as a man who is constantly evolving here, is nothing short of phenomenal. Heston had a few other great performances, but this is the one that stands out and forms the basis of his legacy. We only see Jack Hawkins in on part of the film -- from the battleship to Rome -- but his performance is also right on target. Interestingly, he didn't want to do another spectacle film so soon after "Bridge On The River Kwai", which is probably a better role and performance. But he's still excellent here. Incidentally, this film was made shortly after he had gone through cobalt treatments for what eventually turned out to be throat cancer, which killed him at a relatively young age. Haya Harareet was an Israeli actress who only made 9 films in her career. Nevertheless, even aside from her beauty, this film is her finest performance, and I felt worthy of an Oscar nomination. Stephen Boyd also gave his finest performance in this film, and was just right as the selfish and spiteful antagonist. The whole controversy over whether or not he played his role as if he was a jilted gay lover spurned by Ben-Hur is an interesting one, and based on interviews with Gore Vidal. Hugh Girffith is very good as the Arab sheik. Martha Scott is not a well-remembered actress, but I always thought she was very good and very underrated. As Ben-Hur's mother here, she turns in another durable performance. Sam Jaffe is a treasure as Simonides, and this performance rivals his performance as the abbot in 1937's "Lost Horizon". I have always enjoyed Finlay Currie's performance as Balthazar in this film, and only recently have been discovering some other fine performances by the Scottish actor ("I Know Where I'm Going" and "People Will Talk"). And finally, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate is terrific. And last but not least -- the spectacle. "And a cast of thousands" is certainly true here, excellent sets (particularly for the chariot race), and of course -- that chariot race...probably film-making at its finest and most spectacular. This has it all, with few complaints. This kind of product makes Hollywood proud.

    This is one of what I call the "untouchable" movies and, along with other pieces, this is very hard to rate and review, so I usually avoid that (specially because of the usual aggression that comes from people who think high of those movies). In this case there is one particular aggravation: the quantity of Academy Awards this movie got. As we all know, this is, for many people, a measure of how good a movie is or isn't. Not seeing how much the Academy Awards is biased is, at least for me, a matter of choice (and also a lack of any sense). Being biased or not in this case, and as much as I don't want to, I feel like I should say something about this movie, so here it goes. This movie is as shallow as the ideals of those it tries to please, filled with the standard hypocrisy and bigotry you'll find in most of their minds. It's so pretensions and the acting is so hideous and corny that it's hard to believe that all of the hype around it can still exist, as you think that as time passes people would be more intelligent and critical, and would reject an abomination like this. Charlton Heston is nothing special, but he is particularly bad in this movie. This is a movie that was made to be BIG, and this is where everything revolves for it. It's an epic movie, with an epic number of extras, an epic spending on costumes and setting and equipment and an epic (debatable) soundtrack, which was specifically designed to snatch Oscars. However, from the story to the character development, this is incredibly inferior to many other epics of that time that are much more historically accurate than Ben-Hur and much better executed, with better acting and with more solid plots. The film considers itself to be not only an epic "historical" account, but also thinks it has a deeper meaning. It relies heavily on an appeal to some values, while it tries to develop in the background a story of love, friendship and revenge. It fails miserably in all of those aspects. It fails to convey a meaningful message because its values are devoid of any deepness and usually end up in contradictions. Thus, all of the actions that happen in the movie that are supposed to be linked with these values become meaningless: the conflict of the urge for revenge, etc. The childish notions of love and goodness that it conveys end up spoiling the movie, because this was clearly made for (and to impress.. and sorry for the bluntness).... Christians. It ends up being like a big Sunday school, with artsy cameos by JC himself (in the distance, or off screen, and never showing his face because, you know, it's more artsy that way, and it's also deep, like the "message" of this movie). Some religiosity in movies won't bother you that much, but this one just overdo it, and shows that this was clearly devised for Christian audiences. However, it also fails in the underlining story of Ben-Hur. His love and friendship relationships do not convince, maybe because of Academy Award winner Charlton Heston's (his performance in SOYLENT GREEN is better than this one, seriously) performance, but probably because of the poor development of the characters, which the movie clearly sacrifices to try and push its values to the audience. The costumes, the editing, everything is incredible (except the acting and the plot), and also the infamous chariot race is very well executed, so even if this movie is very slow paced it's still watchable. However, it's dull, with an acting that is hard on the eyes, and very pretentious for a movie with values so shallow and devoid of meaning. Rating: 6,5/10 (I round ratings down)

    One of the greatest Hollywood epics of all time, the first film ever to win the record amount of 11 Academy Awards, most of them well deserved. Charlton Heston stars as the Jewish nobleman Judah Ben-Hur, who finds out his once close friendship with the young Roman aristocrat Messala (Stephen Boyd) has succumbed to his strict duties as a Roman officer. This new distrust between them soon turns to hatred when, after an accident that leaves the new Roman governor of Judea wounded, Messala condemns Judah to the galleys as a slave and sends his family to the dungeons. However, Judah survives his ordeal, fueled by his hate, and in a grandiose naval battle between the Roman fleet and pirates, rescues the life of Roman Consul Arrius (Jack Hawkins), after which he is redeemed by the Emperor, adopted by Arrius and embarks on a star career as a charioteer before returning to Judea to seek vengeance on Messala in the sands of the most famous chariot race in film history. However, winning the race and fatally crippling his adversary in the process does not return his family or his happiness, things only Christ can give him on the Cross. For the majority of modern day viewers, the overt Christian overtones in the final third of the movie  the film is subtitled 'a Tale of the Christ after all  are hard to bear in their cheesiness, but this movie remains a solid undying classic in every other respect (with extra credit going to the great CinemaScope cinematography, the wonderful, catchy music and the excellent production design): the fabulous naval battle and the highly exciting chariot race remain unsurpassed.

    Well, 11 Oscras is not a mere trifle to forget about, but then, there are films that do not age well. Ben-Hur is of that caste, no matter what aficionados would say in anger. I watched it again and again very carefully to get the mood and see how well it speaks to us now. What do we have? The sub-title for the movie stated The Life Of The Christ - yes, Heis there, but this movie is not about Him and is not a Chrisitan movie. Wyler made a very typical grand scheme Hollywood blockbuster that impresses to some degree. Yes, but then, the glaring minuses speak up - 1. The film is tediously overlong, the absolutely unnecessary Prologue and Entr'Acte only kill time. 2. The blatantly obvious poorly painted backstage serving as a city or a valley look laughingly now, and obviously too cheap. 3. The play of main actors is not so deep, too. Overwrought and overblown emotions fit a theater stage more, here they look a bit funny, where it was not to be so. 4. Two most famous scenes - ship battle and horse ride are very long, too, and lack tension. They are well done, yes, but now they pale into banality. 5. The overall sentimental element is too much, too present, too loud that the whole epic dives into a syrupy melodrama. Well, this is a fine time-piece but that is all

    I recently watched this movie again after not seeing it for many years. It was a history lesson in a way, showing the brutality of the Romans, conflict between Rome and nearby nations, a chariot race, and well-known characters from the era (such as Pontius Pilate and Jesus). The action scenes are quite interesting, especially the chariot race - Remember that it wasn't as easy to do these back when the movie was made (no CGI during the 1950's). There are also a lot of themes in the movie (such as love, hate, death, healing, sadness, joy). The movie is long (more than 3 hours), and there are moments without much action, but I never felt bored while watching it. The movie is best appreciated by someone who knows about ancient Rome and Judea, and their culture (if you don't know any of this information the movie will be difficult to understand).

    There hasn't been a classic like the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur in so many years. Charleston Heston is at his best in this epic tale set in ancient Rome, of a man who faces the most dire of hardships for love and honor. It's a story of faith tested. How power can be used for corruption or for mankind's ultimate salvation! If they did a new remake of this film, I don't know if any actor could top this classic star. But with today's effects, I can't imagine how amazing this tale could be. I personally would love to do a remake. Hmm, what actor do you think might do a great remake? My picks might be; Christian Bale, Matt Bomer, Christian Cooke, Devon Sawa or Peter Facinelli for the lead role of Judah Ben-Hur. For the role of Quintus Arrius, Ben-Hur's rival, my picks might be; Ryan Gosling, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Sean Faris or Dave Annable. And for the role of Esther, my picks might be; Mila Kunis, Megan Fox, Lily James, Gal Gadot or Monica Raymund. If you love the classics and stories set in ancient Rome, this is a must see!!!

    Magnificent scenes, moving plot and excellent performances,everything is great! I like it! I once chose the film as the reference of thesis for an elective of my college. Because we could learn a lot of knowledge on the arrangement and design from the scenes of the movie. The 80s would not probably accept this film , I heard a lot of friends said: "The movie was okay!" However, I would think though it up to 4 hours, but it gives you a Open-minded feeling of the epic. And it also helped we to understand what was the artistic aesthetic then. Taken in 1959, era without computer special effects, but the picture is definitely a sense of the 21st century. Likewise the Roman theme, four decades later, even "Gladiator" with a lot of computer effects could not be compared to it.

    Uh. Sorry, folks. I know that Ben-Hur is considered by many to be an all-time classic, and everything, but, hey, aside from the chariot race (which was magnificently done), this dry-as-dust picture pushed the boundaries of monotony just a little too far for this reviewer with its 3.5 hour running time.... Yeah. It sure did. And, believe it or not, I actually sat through Ben-Hur's 3.5 hours of one over-long, dragged out scene after another and waited, and waited, and waited (ho-hum!) for something, anything worthwhile to take place, but it just didn't happen.... Nope. It didn't. (except, of course, for the chariot race) Ben-Hur was a literal biblical soap opera of epic proportions that seriously cried out for some major editing. At least a good hour could have easily been cut out of its story and I'm sure that no one would have ever noticed the diff, one way or the other. Maybe back in 1959 this film's fabricated magic might have worked on its audience like a mesmerizing spell, but that isn't the case today. No way. Considering that this film's tag-line is "A Tale of the Christ", Ben-Hur has got to be one of the most hollow and cheesy biblical stories ever captured on film. About the only memorable scene that the Christ character happened to appear in was when he was carrying his cross (or trying to) on his way to his own crucifixion - And he kept falling down - So someone had to give him a hand with carrying the thing. ( No. Not very impressive, if you ask me) Personally, I think that Ben-Hur was completely unworthy of winning a total of 11 Oscars. Particularly for its win for "Best Picture" (it was up against Anatomy For A Murder and The Diary Of Anne Frank) - And, especially, for "Best Actor", which went to that big phony-baloney with the whitest teeth, and brightest smile, Charlton Heston (who was up against James Stewart and Jack Lemmon). Yep. It was quite plain to see that everything about Ben-Hur said "expensive" (its budget was $16 million), but nothing about it was in the least bit inspirational. In spite of its big-name cast, and hordes-upon-hordes of extras, and all of its eye-popping sets and big-dollar production values, Ben-Hur was a small and petty and frivolous motion picture in so many, many ways.

    This is excellent for what it is, but what is it? Some will say it is an exciting blockbuster, others a Greek tragedy or heroic epic, or even cinematic opera with its focus on riveting but stagy drama and lush, harmonious cinemascope. It is of course all those things woven in one. The story is the same archetypal journey since Ulysses and Mahabharatathe hero is torn in the waking world of logical opposites, good and evil, duty to country against friendship and ambition, defeated with the divine trickery of a loose tile, thrust into hell to suffer oaring for some time, from where he emerges as a 'son' in splendid white clothes, and revitalized returns home to claim victory and love. That is the standard reading anyway such as you'd see in those screen writing guidebooks, not much interesting. It is at the same time a 'tale of the Christ', and this is a bit more fruitful in its spiritual dimension; the film does not end with material victory over the hated opponent, there is no peace to be found there. The idea is that the hero is properly a man when he learns to let go, forgive and accept transience. In this context, the journey is one of self realization not world redemption. You will see this with some clarity when Ben-Hur symbolically visits his mother and sister in some horrible underworld, but he realizes he cannot see them and only listens as they wish him well. Parting from there, he chances upon the Sermon on the Mountone of the three Magi of Bethlehem is there, a mentor who reveals that 'the child is now a man' (he is talking about Jesus) and we know this also applies on a second level to the protagonist.

The latter exhibit a dynamism and placement of the eye inside the swirl of life, for instance the subjective shots of rowers looking out at the battle from ports in the hull of the galley or the powerful shots of dashing chariots as they hurl through the racetrack. There's cinematic energy here that sweeps you into what it is, instead of making you a spectator of opera.

Interestingly, he didn't want to do another spectacle film so soon after "Bridge On The River Kwai", which is probably a better role and performance. But he's still excellent here. Incidentally, this film was made shortly after he had gone through cobalt treatments for what eventually turned out to be throat cancer, which killed him at a relatively young age. Haya Harareet was an Israeli actress who only made 9 films in her career. Nevertheless, even aside from her beauty, this film is her finest performance, and I felt worthy of an Oscar nomination. Stephen Boyd also gave his finest performance in this film, and was just right as the selfish and spiteful antagonist. The whole controversy over whether or not he played his role as if he was a jilted gay lover spurned by Ben-Hur is an interesting one, and based on interviews with Gore Vidal. Hugh Girffith is very good as the Arab sheik. Martha Scott is not a well-remembered actress, but I always thought she was very good and very underrated. As Ben-Hur's mother here, she turns in another durable performance. Sam Jaffe is a treasure as Simonides, and this performance rivals his performance as the abbot in 1937's "Lost Horizon". I have always enjoyed Finlay Currie's performance as Balthazar in this film, and only recently have been discovering some other fine performances by the Scottish actor ("I Know Where I'm Going" and "People Will Talk"). And finally, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate is terrific. And last but not least -- the spectacle. "And a cast of thousands" is certainly true here, excellent sets (particularly for the chariot race), and of course -- that chariot race...probably film-making at its finest and most spectacular. This has it all, with few complaints. This kind of product makes Hollywood proud.

    This is one of what I call the "untouchable" movies and, along with other pieces, this is very hard to rate and review, so I usually avoid that (specially because of the usual aggression that comes from people who think high of those movies). In this case there is one particular aggravation: the quantity of Academy Awards this movie got. As we all know, this is, for many people, a measure of how good a movie is or isn't. Not seeing how much the Academy Awards is biased is, at least for me, a matter of choice (and also a lack of any sense). Being biased or not in this case, and as much as I don't want to, I feel like I should say something about this movie, so here it goes. This movie is as shallow as the ideals of those it tries to please, filled with the standard hypocrisy and bigotry you'll find in most of their minds. It's so pretensions and the acting is so hideous and corny that it's hard to believe that all of the hype around it can still exist, as you think that as time passes people would be more intelligent and critical, and would reject an abomination like this. Charlton Heston is nothing special, but he is particularly bad in this movie. This is a movie that was made to be BIG, and this is where everything revolves for it. It's an epic movie, with an epic number of extras, an epic spending on costumes and setting and equipment and an epic (debatable) soundtrack, which was specifically designed to snatch Oscars. However, from the story to the character development, this is incredibly inferior to many other epics of that time that are much more historically accurate than Ben-Hur and much better executed, with better acting and with more solid plots. The film considers itself to be not only an epic "historical" account, but also thinks it has a deeper meaning. It relies heavily on an appeal to some values, while it tries to develop in the background a story of love, friendship and revenge. It fails miserably in all of those aspects. It fails to convey a meaningful message because its values are devoid of any deepness and usually end up in contradictions. Thus, all of the actions that happen in the movie that are supposed to be linked with these values become meaningless: the conflict of the urge for revenge, etc. The childish notions of love and goodness that it conveys end up spoiling the movie, because this was clearly made for (and to impress.. and sorry for the bluntness).... Christians. It ends up being like a big Sunday school, with artsy cameos by JC himself (in the distance, or off screen, and never showing his face because, you know, it's more artsy that way, and it's also deep, like the "message" of this movie). Some religiosity in movies won't bother you that much, but this one just overdo it, and shows that this was clearly devised for Christian audiences. However, it also fails in the underlining story of Ben-Hur. His love and friendship relationships do not convince, maybe because of Academy Award winner Charlton Heston's (his performance in SOYLENT GREEN is better than this one, seriously) performance, but probably because of the poor development of the characters, which the movie clearly sacrifices to try and push its values to the audience. The costumes, the editing, everything is incredible (except the acting and the plot), and also the infamous chariot race is very well executed, so even if this movie is very slow paced it's still watchable. However, it's dull, with an acting that is hard on the eyes, and very pretentious for a movie with values so shallow and devoid of meaning. Rating: 6,5/10 (I round ratings down)

    One of the greatest Hollywood epics of all time, the first film ever to win the record amount of 11 Academy Awards, most of them well deserved. Charlton Heston stars as the Jewish nobleman Judah Ben-Hur, who finds out his once close friendship with the young Roman aristocrat Messala (Stephen Boyd) has succumbed to his strict duties as a Roman officer. This new distrust between them soon turns to hatred when, after an accident that leaves the new Roman governor of Judea wounded, Messala condemns Judah to the galleys as a slave and sends his family to the dungeons. However, Judah survives his ordeal, fueled by his hate, and in a grandiose naval battle between the Roman fleet and pirates, rescues the life of Roman Consul Arrius (Jack Hawkins), after which he is redeemed by the Emperor, adopted by Arrius and embarks on a star career as a charioteer before returning to Judea to seek vengeance on Messala in the sands of the most famous chariot race in film history. However, winning the race and fatally crippling his adversary in the process does not return his family or his happiness, things only Christ can give him on the Cross. For the majority of modern day viewers, the overt Christian overtones in the final third of the movie  the film is subtitled 'a Tale of the Christ after all  are hard to bear in their cheesiness, but this movie remains a solid undying classic in every other respect (with extra credit going to the great CinemaScope cinematography, the wonderful, catchy music and the excellent production design): the fabulous naval battle and the highly exciting chariot race remain unsurpassed.

    Well, 11 Oscras is not a mere trifle to forget about, but then, there are films that do not age well. Ben-Hur is of that caste, no matter what aficionados would say in anger. I watched it again and again very carefully to get the mood and see how well it speaks to us now. What do we have? The sub-title for the movie stated The Life Of The Christ - yes, Heis there, but this movie is not about Him and is not a Chrisitan movie. Wyler made a very typical grand scheme Hollywood blockbuster that impresses to some degree. Yes, but then, the glaring minuses speak up - 1. The film is tediously overlong, the absolutely unnecessary Prologue and Entr'Acte only kill time. 2. The blatantly obvious poorly painted backstage serving as a city or a valley look laughingly now, and obviously too cheap. 3. The play of main actors is not so deep, too. Overwrought and overblown emotions fit a theater stage more, here they look a bit funny, where it was not to be so. 4. Two most famous scenes - ship battle and horse ride are very long, too, and lack tension. They are well done, yes, but now they pale into banality. 5. The overall sentimental element is too much, too present, too loud that the whole epic dives into a syrupy melodrama. Well, this is a fine time-piece but that is all

    I recently watched this movie again after not seeing it for many years. It was a history lesson in a way, showing the brutality of the Romans, conflict between Rome and nearby nations, a chariot race, and well-known characters from the era (such as Pontius Pilate and Jesus). The action scenes are quite interesting, especially the chariot race - Remember that it wasn't as easy to do these back when the movie was made (no CGI during the 1950's). There are also a lot of themes in the movie (such as love, hate, death, healing, sadness, joy). The movie is long (more than 3 hours), and there are moments without much action, but I never felt bored while watching it. The movie is best appreciated by someone who knows about ancient Rome and Judea, and their culture (if you don't know any of this information the movie will be difficult to understand).

    There hasn't been a classic like the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur in so many years. Charleston Heston is at his best in this epic tale set in ancient Rome, of a man who faces the most dire of hardships for love and honor. It's a story of faith tested. How power can be used for corruption or for mankind's ultimate salvation! If they did a new remake of this film, I don't know if any actor could top this classic star. But with today's effects, I can't imagine how amazing this tale could be. I personally would love to do a remake. Hmm, what actor do you think might do a great remake? My picks might be; Christian Bale, Matt Bomer, Christian Cooke, Devon Sawa or Peter Facinelli for the lead role of Judah Ben-Hur. For the role of Quintus Arrius, Ben-Hur's rival, my picks might be; Ryan Gosling, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Sean Faris or Dave Annable. And for the role of Esther, my picks might be; Mila Kunis, Megan Fox, Lily James, Gal Gadot or Monica Raymund. If you love the classics and stories set in ancient Rome, this is a must see!!!

    Magnificent scenes, moving plot and excellent performances,everything is great! I like it! I once chose the film as the reference of thesis for an elective of my college. Because we could learn a lot of knowledge on the arrangement and design from the scenes of the movie. The 80s would not probably accept this film , I heard a lot of friends said: "The movie was okay!" However, I would think though it up to 4 hours, but it gives you a Open-minded feeling of the epic. And it also helped we to understand what was the artistic aesthetic then. Taken in 1959, era without computer special effects, but the picture is definitely a sense of the 21st century. Likewise the Roman theme, four decades later, even "Gladiator" with a lot of computer effects could not be compared to it.

    Uh. Sorry, folks. I know that Ben-Hur is considered by many to be an all-time classic, and everything, but, hey, aside from the chariot race (which was magnificently done), this dry-as-dust picture pushed the boundaries of monotony just a little too far for this reviewer with its 3.5 hour running time.... Yeah. It sure did. And, believe it or not, I actually sat through Ben-Hur's 3.5 hours of one over-long, dragged out scene after another and waited, and waited, and waited (ho-hum!) for something, anything worthwhile to take place, but it just didn't happen.... Nope. It didn't. (except, of course, for the chariot race) Ben-Hur was a literal biblical soap opera of epic proportions that seriously cried out for some major editing. At least a good hour could have easily been cut out of its story and I'm sure that no one would have ever noticed the diff, one way or the other. Maybe back in 1959 this film's fabricated magic might have worked on its audience like a mesmerizing spell, but that isn't the case today. No way. Considering that this film's tag-line is "A Tale of the Christ", Ben-Hur has got to be one of the most hollow and cheesy biblical stories ever captured on film. About the only memorable scene that the Christ character happened to appear in was when he was carrying his cross (or trying to) on his way to his own crucifixion - And he kept falling down - So someone had to give him a hand with carrying the thing. ( No. Not very impressive, if you ask me) Personally, I think that Ben-Hur was completely unworthy of winning a total of 11 Oscars. Particularly for its win for "Best Picture" (it was up against Anatomy For A Murder and The Diary Of Anne Frank) - And, especially, for "Best Actor", which went to that big phony-baloney with the whitest teeth, and brightest smile, Charlton Heston (who was up against James Stewart and Jack Lemmon). Yep. It was quite plain to see that everything about Ben-Hur said "expensive" (its budget was $16 million), but nothing about it was in the least bit inspirational. In spite of its big-name cast, and hordes-upon-hordes of extras, and all of its eye-popping sets and big-dollar production values, Ben-Hur was a small and petty and frivolous motion picture in so many, many ways.

    This is excellent for what it is, but what is it? Some will say it is an exciting blockbuster, others a Greek tragedy or heroic epic, or even cinematic opera with its focus on riveting but stagy drama and lush, harmonious cinemascope. It is of course all those things woven in one. The story is the same archetypal journey since Ulysses and Mahabharatathe hero is torn in the waking world of logical opposites, good and evil, duty to country against friendship and ambition, defeated with the divine trickery of a loose tile, thrust into hell to suffer oaring for some time, from where he emerges as a 'son' in splendid white clothes, and revitalized returns home to claim victory and love. That is the standard reading anyway such as you'd see in those screen writing guidebooks, not much interesting. It is at the same time a 'tale of the Christ', and this is a bit more fruitful in its spiritual dimension; the film does not end with material victory over the hated opponent, there is no peace to be found there. The idea is that the hero is properly a man when he learns to let go, forgive and accept transience. In this context, the journey is one of self realization not world redemption. You will see this with some clarity when Ben-Hur symbolically visits his mother and sister in some horrible underworld, but he realizes he cannot see them and only listens as they wish him well. Parting from there, he chances upon the Sermon on the Mountone of the three Magi of Bethlehem is there, a mentor who reveals that 'the child is now a man' (he is talking about Jesus) and we know this also applies on a second level to the protagonist. But he won't listen, being perhaps too proud or harried to sit and reflect, which only prolongs his torment for a while more, that is until he realizes who the rabbi is and follows the passions from up close. Oh the presentation is archaic and sermonizing, which is to say from the outside, symbolically presenting reflection but not making it the fabric so that you reflect. What is of more interest to me is noting this bit on the cinematic dimension: the contrast between a placid theatricality in the Jesus portions, with some exciting perspectives in the ship and chariot race segments which captivate the eye. The first is impersonal and removed from experience, imparting the awe of spectacle but not the spiritual essence, you will see for instance Calvary Hill as a stage in the distance. The latter exhibit a dynamism and placement of the eye inside the swirl of life, for instance the subjective shots of rowers looking out at the battle from ports in the hull of the galley or the powerful shots of dashing chariots as they hurl through the racetrack. There's cinematic energy here that sweeps you into what it is, instead of making you a spectator of opera. What is interesting is that the filmmaker, the very talented Wyler, had the immersive means but rested his hand outside the action.

    For more than 100 years, the tale of Ben Hur has staggered the imaginations of audiences worldwide, as indicated by its successful publication history, having at least three different film adaptations, and even a stage play adaptation. Of all the exposure this story has received, much of its acclaim may be attributed to its famous 1959 film adaptation, which remains a classic in epic cinema, and a standard Easter holiday favorite. Whether you've heard of Ben Hur or not, chances are good that you've seen this film referenced or mentioned somewhere in pop culture. It stands as one of the biggest, most epic, most ambitious productions in cinema to date. It's most impressive in how it employed thousands of extras, over a million props, and some very expensive and lavish setpieces to bring this larger-than-life tale to life. Even if you aren't marveling at the sheer scope and scale of this film, the chariot race in the film's final act will have you at the edge of your seat. It's a long, uncompromising, real-looking sequence that's still thrilling and intense, and it should stand as one of the best racing scenes of all time. There is a really neat sea battle in the film's first half, which offers even more thrills and violence to behold. For the most part, however, this is a film more heavily built on drama and characterization. Parts of it remain enthralling, as we watch the title character suffer and fight his way through adversity. However, in between the major turning events and the action scenes, the film's momentum does suffer a massive slump. The pacing in certain scenes never agreed with me personally, and is really the only issue I take with this fine picture. The story for this film is perfectly sound and well-built. Judah Ben Hur is a well-rounded character we can follow easily enough and relate to; his rivalry with Messala provides the conflict to drive the plot forward, and digs up some interesting themes of vengeance and hatred. What really propels the film above and beyond will be the story of Christ, running in tandem with Ben Hur's story; both story lines become entwined to reveal strong themes of redemption and salvation. I have no clue how closely this adapts Lew Wallace's original novel, but on its own merits, this film offers a decently insightful story. Captured with a sweeping widescreen frame on a pristine 70mm film stock, this film looks every bit as big as it is. Just about every shot is carefully calculated to best present the imagery with incredible amounts of detail. It uses a lot of long shots, which never felt all that intimate or interesting to me personally, but it is definitely a big-scale picture with lots of impressive shots. Acting is pleasing; Charlton Heston plays Ben Hur with enough nuance and machismo to make the character cool and memorable. The rest of the cast do their best. Writing is not too bad either. This production spares no expense on its massive sets, props, costumes, and visual effects. Music is just as big and ambitious as the rest of the movie is. For its sheer epicness and classic status, this film comes highly recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)

    I want to begin by saying that I watched this film...again...on Easter weekend, and, by coincidence, when I had just learned that MGM is planning a remake. I'm usually not a big fan of remakes, but I think in this case it will -- at the very least -- be interesting. I understand that the new script will be closer to the story as written by General Lew Wallace. Let me skip to my recent experience of watching the new Oz film...not bad...enjoyable...but knowing that virtually every scene in that movie was filmed in front of a blue/green screen kinda ruined it for me...I felt as if the actors were simply placed within a cartoon. Much as the rather over-the-top special effects in the final Indiana Jones movie ruined that for me. There's nothing wrong with special effects...they're in all films to some degree or another...but it's getting to the point where so many films focus on the special effects that we are losing the ability to judge fine acting and fine script-writing. I fear the remake of "Ben-Hur" may end of that way, also -- a special effects extravaganza that will make the new film a shadow of this classic. I mentioned that this is my second-favorite film...just behind "Gone With The Wind", and that's partly because each had a superior story, and each was ahead of its time in terms of sheer movie-making. It seems to me that "Ben-Hur" pretty much has it all, beginning with a superb story (even if you're not a Christian) and a very fine script. And then there's the acting. I'm going to hand out so many kudos here, that I feel I should begin with the one performance that was shallow and so passive as to be nearly worthless -- that of Cathy O'Donnell as Ben-Hur's sister, Tirzah. How bland can an actress get? O'Donnell answered that question definitively. No wonder this was her final film, and that after this she showed up in mostly bit parts on television. Charleton Heston is an actor that I simply can't stand any longer. I won't watch any of his films, with two exceptions: "The Ten Commandments" (because it's hard to resist the spectacle of a Cecil B. DeMille film) and "Ben-Hur". As much as I dislike the man because of his political stands, I have to admit that his acting here is absolutely superb and spot-on. His performance as a man who is constantly evolving here, is nothing short of phenomenal. Heston had a few other great performances, but this is the one that stands out and forms the basis of his legacy. We only see Jack Hawkins in on part of the film -- from the battleship to Rome -- but his performance is also right on target. Interestingly, he didn't want to do another spectacle film so soon after "Bridge On The River Kwai", which is probably a better role and performance. But he's still excellent here. Incidentally, this film was made shortly after he had gone through cobalt treatments for what eventually turned out to be throat cancer, which killed him at a relatively young age. Haya Harareet was an Israeli actress who only made 9 films in her career. Nevertheless, even aside from her beauty, this film is her finest performance, and I felt worthy of an Oscar nomination. Stephen Boyd also gave his finest performance in this film, and was just right as the selfish and spiteful antagonist. The whole controversy over whether or not he played his role as if he was a jilted gay lover spurned by Ben-Hur is an interesting one, and based on interviews with Gore Vidal. Hugh Girffith is very good as the Arab sheik. Martha Scott is not a well-remembered actress, but I always thought she was very good and very underrated. As Ben-Hur's mother here, she turns in another durable performance. Sam Jaffe is a treasure as Simonides, and this performance rivals his performance as the abbot in 1937's "Lost Horizon". I have always enjoyed Finlay Currie's performance as Balthazar in this film, and only recently have been discovering some other fine performances by the Scottish actor ("I Know Where I'm Going" and "People Will Talk"). And finally, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate is terrific. And last but not least -- the spectacle. "And a cast of thousands" is certainly true here, excellent sets (particularly for the chariot race), and of course -- that chariot race...probably film-making at its finest and most spectacular.

I watched it again and again very carefully to get the mood and see how well it speaks to us now. What do we have? The sub-title for the movie stated The Life Of The Christ - yes, Heis there, but this movie is not about Him and is not a Chrisitan movie. Wyler made a very typical grand scheme Hollywood blockbuster that impresses to some degree. Yes, but then, the glaring minuses speak up - 1. The film is tediously overlong, the absolutely unnecessary Prologue and Entr'Acte only kill time. 2. The blatantly obvious poorly painted backstage serving as a city or a valley look laughingly now, and obviously too cheap. 3. The play of main actors is not so deep, too. Overwrought and overblown emotions fit a theater stage more, here they look a bit funny, where it was not to be so. 4. Two most famous scenes - ship battle and horse ride are very long, too, and lack tension. They are well done, yes, but now they pale into banality. 5. The overall sentimental element is too much, too present, too loud that the whole epic dives into a syrupy melodrama. Well, this is a fine time-piece but that is all

    I recently watched this movie again after not seeing it for many years. It was a history lesson in a way, showing the brutality of the Romans, conflict between Rome and nearby nations, a chariot race, and well-known characters from the era (such as Pontius Pilate and Jesus). The action scenes are quite interesting, especially the chariot race - Remember that it wasn't as easy to do these back when the movie was made (no CGI during the 1950's). There are also a lot of themes in the movie (such as love, hate, death, healing, sadness, joy). The movie is long (more than 3 hours), and there are moments without much action, but I never felt bored while watching it. The movie is best appreciated by someone who knows about ancient Rome and Judea, and their culture (if you don't know any of this information the movie will be difficult to understand).

    There hasn't been a classic like the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur in so many years. Charleston Heston is at his best in this epic tale set in ancient Rome, of a man who faces the most dire of hardships for love and honor. It's a story of faith tested. How power can be used for corruption or for mankind's ultimate salvation! If they did a new remake of this film, I don't know if any actor could top this classic star. But with today's effects, I can't imagine how amazing this tale could be. I personally would love to do a remake. Hmm, what actor do you think might do a great remake? My picks might be; Christian Bale, Matt Bomer, Christian Cooke, Devon Sawa or Peter Facinelli for the lead role of Judah Ben-Hur. For the role of Quintus Arrius, Ben-Hur's rival, my picks might be; Ryan Gosling, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Sean Faris or Dave Annable. And for the role of Esther, my picks might be; Mila Kunis, Megan Fox, Lily James, Gal Gadot or Monica Raymund. If you love the classics and stories set in ancient Rome, this is a must see!!!

    Magnificent scenes, moving plot and excellent performances,everything is great! I like it! I once chose the film as the reference of thesis for an elective of my college. Because we could learn a lot of knowledge on the arrangement and design from the scenes of the movie. The 80s would not probably accept this film , I heard a lot of friends said: "The movie was okay!" However, I would think though it up to 4 hours, but it gives you a Open-minded feeling of the epic. And it also helped we to understand what was the artistic aesthetic then. Taken in 1959, era without computer special effects, but the picture is definitely a sense of the 21st century. Likewise the Roman theme, four decades later, even "Gladiator" with a lot of computer effects could not be compared to it.

    Uh. Sorry, folks. I know that Ben-Hur is considered by many to be an all-time classic, and everything, but, hey, aside from the chariot race (which was magnificently done), this dry-as-dust picture pushed the boundaries of monotony just a little too far for this reviewer with its 3.5 hour running time.... Yeah. It sure did. And, believe it or not, I actually sat through Ben-Hur's 3.5 hours of one over-long, dragged out scene after another and waited, and waited, and waited (ho-hum!) for something, anything worthwhile to take place, but it just didn't happen.... Nope. It didn't. (except, of course, for the chariot race) Ben-Hur was a literal biblical soap opera of epic proportions that seriously cried out for some major editing. At least a good hour could have easily been cut out of its story and I'm sure that no one would have ever noticed the diff, one way or the other. Maybe back in 1959 this film's fabricated magic might have worked on its audience like a mesmerizing spell, but that isn't the case today. No way. Considering that this film's tag-line is "A Tale of the Christ", Ben-Hur has got to be one of the most hollow and cheesy biblical stories ever captured on film. About the only memorable scene that the Christ character happened to appear in was when he was carrying his cross (or trying to) on his way to his own crucifixion - And he kept falling down - So someone had to give him a hand with carrying the thing. ( No. Not very impressive, if you ask me) Personally, I think that Ben-Hur was completely unworthy of winning a total of 11 Oscars. Particularly for its win for "Best Picture" (it was up against Anatomy For A Murder and The Diary Of Anne Frank) - And, especially, for "Best Actor", which went to that big phony-baloney with the whitest teeth, and brightest smile, Charlton Heston (who was up against James Stewart and Jack Lemmon). Yep. It was quite plain to see that everything about Ben-Hur said "expensive" (its budget was $16 million), but nothing about it was in the least bit inspirational. In spite of its big-name cast, and hordes-upon-hordes of extras, and all of its eye-popping sets and big-dollar production values, Ben-Hur was a small and petty and frivolous motion picture in so many, many ways.

    This is excellent for what it is, but what is it? Some will say it is an exciting blockbuster, others a Greek tragedy or heroic epic, or even cinematic opera with its focus on riveting but stagy drama and lush, harmonious cinemascope. It is of course all those things woven in one. The story is the same archetypal journey since Ulysses and Mahabharatathe hero is torn in the waking world of logical opposites, good and evil, duty to country against friendship and ambition, defeated with the divine trickery of a loose tile, thrust into hell to suffer oaring for some time, from where he emerges as a 'son' in splendid white clothes, and revitalized returns home to claim victory and love. That is the standard reading anyway such as you'd see in those screen writing guidebooks, not much interesting. It is at the same time a 'tale of the Christ', and this is a bit more fruitful in its spiritual dimension; the film does not end with material victory over the hated opponent, there is no peace to be found there. The idea is that the hero is properly a man when he learns to let go, forgive and accept transience. In this context, the journey is one of self realization not world redemption. You will see this with some clarity when Ben-Hur symbolically visits his mother and sister in some horrible underworld, but he realizes he cannot see them and only listens as they wish him well. Parting from there, he chances upon the Sermon on the Mountone of the three Magi of Bethlehem is there, a mentor who reveals that 'the child is now a man' (he is talking about Jesus) and we know this also applies on a second level to the protagonist. But he won't listen, being perhaps too proud or harried to sit and reflect, which only prolongs his torment for a while more, that is until he realizes who the rabbi is and follows the passions from up close. Oh the presentation is archaic and sermonizing, which is to say from the outside, symbolically presenting reflection but not making it the fabric so that you reflect. What is of more interest to me is noting this bit on the cinematic dimension: the contrast between a placid theatricality in the Jesus portions, with some exciting perspectives in the ship and chariot race segments which captivate the eye. The first is impersonal and removed from experience, imparting the awe of spectacle but not the spiritual essence, you will see for instance Calvary Hill as a stage in the distance. The latter exhibit a dynamism and placement of the eye inside the swirl of life, for instance the subjective shots of rowers looking out at the battle from ports in the hull of the galley or the powerful shots of dashing chariots as they hurl through the racetrack. There's cinematic energy here that sweeps you into what it is, instead of making you a spectator of opera. What is interesting is that the filmmaker, the very talented Wyler, had the immersive means but rested his hand outside the action.

    For more than 100 years, the tale of Ben Hur has staggered the imaginations of audiences worldwide, as indicated by its successful publication history, having at least three different film adaptations, and even a stage play adaptation. Of all the exposure this story has received, much of its acclaim may be attributed to its famous 1959 film adaptation, which remains a classic in epic cinema, and a standard Easter holiday favorite. Whether you've heard of Ben Hur or not, chances are good that you've seen this film referenced or mentioned somewhere in pop culture. It stands as one of the biggest, most epic, most ambitious productions in cinema to date. It's most impressive in how it employed thousands of extras, over a million props, and some very expensive and lavish setpieces to bring this larger-than-life tale to life. Even if you aren't marveling at the sheer scope and scale of this film, the chariot race in the film's final act will have you at the edge of your seat. It's a long, uncompromising, real-looking sequence that's still thrilling and intense, and it should stand as one of the best racing scenes of all time. There is a really neat sea battle in the film's first half, which offers even more thrills and violence to behold. For the most part, however, this is a film more heavily built on drama and characterization. Parts of it remain enthralling, as we watch the title character suffer and fight his way through adversity. However, in between the major turning events and the action scenes, the film's momentum does suffer a massive slump. The pacing in certain scenes never agreed with me personally, and is really the only issue I take with this fine picture. The story for this film is perfectly sound and well-built. Judah Ben Hur is a well-rounded character we can follow easily enough and relate to; his rivalry with Messala provides the conflict to drive the plot forward, and digs up some interesting themes of vengeance and hatred. What really propels the film above and beyond will be the story of Christ, running in tandem with Ben Hur's story; both story lines become entwined to reveal strong themes of redemption and salvation. I have no clue how closely this adapts Lew Wallace's original novel, but on its own merits, this film offers a decently insightful story. Captured with a sweeping widescreen frame on a pristine 70mm film stock, this film looks every bit as big as it is. Just about every shot is carefully calculated to best present the imagery with incredible amounts of detail. It uses a lot of long shots, which never felt all that intimate or interesting to me personally, but it is definitely a big-scale picture with lots of impressive shots. Acting is pleasing; Charlton Heston plays Ben Hur with enough nuance and machismo to make the character cool and memorable. The rest of the cast do their best. Writing is not too bad either. This production spares no expense on its massive sets, props, costumes, and visual effects. Music is just as big and ambitious as the rest of the movie is. For its sheer epicness and classic status, this film comes highly recommended. 4/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)

    I want to begin by saying that I watched this film...again...on Easter weekend, and, by coincidence, when I had just learned that MGM is planning a remake. I'm usually not a big fan of remakes, but I think in this case it will -- at the very least -- be interesting. I understand that the new script will be closer to the story as written by General Lew Wallace. Let me skip to my recent experience of watching the new Oz film...not bad...enjoyable...but knowing that virtually every scene in that movie was filmed in front of a blue/green screen kinda ruined it for me...I felt as if the actors were simply placed within a cartoon. Much as the rather over-the-top special effects in the final Indiana Jones movie ruined that for me. There's nothing wrong with special effects...they're in all films to some degree or another...but it's getting to the point where so many films focus on the special effects that we are losing the ability to judge fine acting and fine script-writing. I fear the remake of "Ben-Hur" may end of that way, also -- a special effects extravaganza that will make the new film a shadow of this classic. I mentioned that this is my second-favorite film...just behind "Gone With The Wind", and that's partly because each had a superior story, and each was ahead of its time in terms of sheer movie-making. It seems to me that "Ben-Hur" pretty much has it all, beginning with a superb story (even if you're not a Christian) and a very fine script. And then there's the acting. I'm going to hand out so many kudos here, that I feel I should begin with the one performance that was shallow and so passive as to be nearly worthless -- that of Cathy O'Donnell as Ben-Hur's sister, Tirzah. How bland can an actress get? O'Donnell answered that question definitively. No wonder this was her final film, and that after this she showed up in mostly bit parts on television. Charleton Heston is an actor that I simply can't stand any longer. I won't watch any of his films, with two exceptions: "The Ten Commandments" (because it's hard to resist the spectacle of a Cecil B. DeMille film) and "Ben-Hur". As much as I dislike the man because of his political stands, I have to admit that his acting here is absolutely superb and spot-on. His performance as a man who is constantly evolving here, is nothing short of phenomenal. Heston had a few other great performances, but this is the one that stands out and forms the basis of his legacy. We only see Jack Hawkins in on part of the film -- from the battleship to Rome -- but his performance is also right on target. Interestingly, he didn't want to do another spectacle film so soon after "Bridge On The River Kwai", which is probably a better role and performance. But he's still excellent here. Incidentally, this film was made shortly after he had gone through cobalt treatments for what eventually turned out to be throat cancer, which killed him at a relatively young age. Haya Harareet was an Israeli actress who only made 9 films in her career. Nevertheless, even aside from her beauty, this film is her finest performance, and I felt worthy of an Oscar nomination. Stephen Boyd also gave his finest performance in this film, and was just right as the selfish and spiteful antagonist. The whole controversy over whether or not he played his role as if he was a jilted gay lover spurned by Ben-Hur is an interesting one, and based on interviews with Gore Vidal. Hugh Girffith is very good as the Arab sheik. Martha Scott is not a well-remembered actress, but I always thought she was very good and very underrated. As Ben-Hur's mother here, she turns in another durable performance. Sam Jaffe is a treasure as Simonides, and this performance rivals his performance as the abbot in 1937's "Lost Horizon". I have always enjoyed Finlay Currie's performance as Balthazar in this film, and only recently have been discovering some other fine performances by the Scottish actor ("I Know Where I'm Going" and "People Will Talk"). And finally, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate is terrific. And last but not least -- the spectacle. "And a cast of thousands" is certainly true here, excellent sets (particularly for the chariot race), and of course -- that chariot race...probably film-making at its finest and most spectacular. This has it all, with few complaints. This kind of product makes Hollywood proud.

    This is one of what I call the "untouchable" movies and, along with other pieces, this is very hard to rate and review, so I usually avoid that (specially because of the usual aggression that comes from people who think high of those movies). In this case there is one particular aggravation: the quantity of Academy Awards this movie got. As we all know, this is, for many people, a measure of how good a movie is or isn't. Not seeing how much the Academy Awards is biased is, at least for me, a matter of choice (and also a lack of any sense). Being biased or not in this case, and as much as I don't want to, I feel like I should say something about this movie, so here it goes. This movie is as shallow as the ideals of those it tries to please, filled with the standard hypocrisy and bigotry you'll find in most of their minds. It's so pretensions and the acting is so hideous and corny that it's hard to believe that all of the hype around it can still exist, as you think that as time passes people would be more intelligent and critical, and would reject an abomination like this. Charlton Heston is nothing special, but he is particularly bad in this movie. This is a movie that was made to be BIG, and this is where everything revolves for it. It's an epic movie, with an epic number of extras, an epic spending on costumes and setting and equipment and an epic (debatable) soundtrack, which was specifically designed to snatch Oscars. However, from the story to the character development, this is incredibly inferior to many other epics of that time that are much more historically accurate than Ben-Hur and much better executed, with better acting and with more solid plots. The film considers itself to be not only an epic "historical" account, but also thinks it has a deeper meaning. It relies heavily on an appeal to some values, while it tries to develop in the background a story of love, friendship and revenge. It fails miserably in all of those aspects. It fails to convey a meaningful message because its values are devoid of any deepness and usually end up in contradictions. Thus, all of the actions that happen in the movie that are supposed to be linked with these values become meaningless: the conflict of the urge for revenge, etc. The childish notions of love and goodness that it conveys end up spoiling the movie, because this was clearly made for (and to impress.. and sorry for the bluntness).... Christians. It ends up being like a big Sunday school, with artsy cameos by JC himself (in the distance, or off screen, and never showing his face because, you know, it's more artsy that way, and it's also deep, like the "message" of this movie). Some religiosity in movies won't bother you that much, but this one just overdo it, and shows that this was clearly devised for Christian audiences. However, it also fails in the underlining story of Ben-Hur. His love and friendship relationships do not convince, maybe because of Academy Award winner Charlton Heston's (his performance in SOYLENT GREEN is better than this one, seriously) performance, but probably because of the poor development of the characters, which the movie clearly sacrifices to try and push its values to the audience. The costumes, the editing, everything is incredible (except the acting and the plot), and also the infamous chariot race is very well executed, so even if this movie is very slow paced it's still watchable. However, it's dull, with an acting that is hard on the eyes, and very pretentious for a movie with values so shallow and devoid of meaning. Rating: 6,5/10 (I round ratings down)
