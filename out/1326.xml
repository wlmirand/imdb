    This was a very good movie. I even enjoyed it being a man, since this type of movies are generally geared towards the female gender. I've actually seen it quiet a few times. Maybe it's because I'm a huge Winona Ryder fan, but in any regards, this film is definitely worth watching. I personally would own it on DVD/Bluray but that's just me. A great film should be owned & added to the person's Movie Library. I think this film probably 1 day will become a classic. Sometimes we miss the obvious classics because there are so many movies that come out all the time, & they make people or at least some people forget what they recently saw. It's nobody's fault, it's just the way it goes. 10/10 for this pleasure of a film.

    I liked this movie. Imagine a teenager, named John, the typical guy who goes to the last year of high school and doesn't quite know what to do with his life. Then, one day, he finds a beautiful woman lying on the floor in a field who, apparently, is on the run for something she did and takes her to his room. It's a boarding school, he might get kicked out, but he doesn't care; he just wants to help her. The look on his face when the woman first wakes up and the teenager walks towards her, is the first sign of a magical performance by Lukas Hass; it's a look that combines the excitement of having this woman in his bed and the curiosity of wanting to know what she might have done. The woman is called Patty Vare, played by the wonderful Winona Ryder in the kind of role she knows by heart but never forgets to add new elements to. Here, besides appearing to be somewhere other than the real world (she fell off a horse before John found her and doesn't remember much), she masters the 'look'; that seductive look only she can achieve and makes anyone go crazy to the point that they would do anything for her. Well, at least that's the effect it had on John in the movieAnd on me, of course. But don't get things wrong. I personally don't think "Boys" is a romantic movie, even if it was writer/director Stacy Cochran's intention. I would call it some kind of an 'age analysis'. Yes, there are romance related moments that make you smile because Winona is an expert on the subject, but this time her character Patty is an expert too: on men. So the study the film tries to make is what can happen when a woman of Patty's experience meets a kid like John in an extreme situation. That's why Cochran shows us flashbacks of what happened to Patty before meeting John; they're necessary for us to know the kind of woman she is. On the other hand, we don't know anything about John but the fact that he has a bad relationship with his father (a respectable Chris Cooper). But we don't need to know, because we realize when he is with Patty; when we hear what he says and see what he does. There's a scene in the town fair, where Patty and John are together in the merry-go-round. The final moment of that scene explains why I liked this movie, and those are the scenes in the movie that work. Not the police sub-plot (led by a convincing John C. Reilly), not John's relationship with his friends at school (although some scenes are good to watch more of Hass' perfect work), not even the conflict with his father. There's another scene really worth paying attention too: a chat in a table where a beautiful light from the window makes Patty seem so vulnerable. Luckily for us, this is a movie where we have the final world; about whether we believe the characters or not and about the inconclusive and far-fetched ending. Yes, it may not honor reality itself, but "Boys" honors its title; and I liked that. I liked this movie.

    I liked this movie a lot. Visually, it is just so appealing in a very mystical sort of way. I don't get why nobody gets this movie. While the story doesn't quite hold up as well as the photography and the ending is way eighties, if you are a poetic person, you will get into this. In a weird sort of way it has a bit of the Love Story appeal. There is just something about it that can't be explained. A lot of the appeal has to do with winona ryder, she has never looked more magnetic...trust me. She actually does a very good acting job with this, in fact she probably saves the movie with her appeal and acting skills. There are certain scenes in this flick that will just float you away...like the one where the two main characters make love in the woods behind the carnival...classic. The first fifteen minutes are very interesting also. To sum up a rambling review just let me say this is one for are searching for something poetic and different in a movie. This is one for the fans of beautiful, sensitive people, falling leaves, and cobblestone paths.

    A young prep school teen(Lukas Haas, quite good)gets involved with a mysterious young woman(Winona Ryder, who doesn't register or emote..not one of her better performances)who has a secret she is hiding. During the film snippets of a past acquaintance(Skeet Ulrich)may answer that very secret. Chris Cooper has a thankless, clich&eacute;d role as profane, short-fused father of Haas. Jessica Harper has the thankless role as Haas' mother, the typical hush-hush-wife afraid of her hot-tempered husband. John C Reilly also has a minor role as a kindly officer trying to locate Ryder over the whereabouts of baseball star Ulrich. The oh-so-big mystery isn't anything to write home about and Ryder is merely a confused dame. The supposed fireworks between Haas and Ryder is non-existent & the film is really unfocused. We get a lot of story on Haas' life in a school for rich annoying kids and with little chemistry between the leads(not to mention a plot which doesn't provide us much in why either would prefer to have such a relationship), there is very little to get excited about. I'd say see the film for Haas' performance, because the rest of this mediocre effort isn't worth your time.

    i started watching this film late one night. i was immediately interested. the music and the tension between the characters was mesmerizing. although some of the characters actions did seem unrealistic. i did not watch the rest of the film until the next evening. all day long, i happily anticipated getting back to this movie. watching the rest of the film was less than satisfying. relationships developed and/or pre-existed without explanation. i was amazed when the credits rolled. i felt a whole chunk of movie had gone missing. i really wanted more from this film. and the potential for being great was there. ryder and haas were intense and had chemistry together. peripheral characters had charisma, others were detestable. then, others seemed pointless. the "problem" in the story did not match the intensity of the mystery in the beginning of the movie. i do not recommend watching this film. there just isn't enough "meat" to make it worthwhile.

    Look, you don't watch every movie because it's a good movie. "Boys"  the title has wandered in from some gay porno flick shopping list -- is for all intents and purposes a bad movie and even nice film critics have been mean to it. But if this is a failure, this is not your average failure. Oh, no. It has moments, and an interesting, borderline cultish, cast. Skeet Ulrich is almost forgotten, but in his fleeting appearances he has a dysfunctional neediness, luminous sex appeal, a scary attraction  you see that also in "As Good As It Gets," where he robs and beats up Greg Kinnear. There's something dangerous  and expendable  about Skeet. We may think of John C. Reilly in PT Anderson's "Magnolia," and see that same homely touching appeal on idle here in his Maryland State Police role. This was probably the only time the mercurial, offbeat Lucas Haas was conventionally cute enough to match up with a pretty -- at times quite beautiful -- girl like Winona. And her dazed, out-of-it quality  she's clearly a young lady who makes nothing but wrong choices in men -- contributes to the curiously touching moments the two have in the amusement park when the high school boy briefly but intensely falls for the 25-year-old and proposes marriage and eternal loyalty and they kiss sweetly and the rest of the world disappears. That's the high point. Now, there's nothing more tedious than the boys in the opening segment nattering at each other, threatening to rat on each other, but curious to get in on any trouble that's going to come downbut the way they behave and look in this movie is completely natural and believable. Like most real schoolboys they're likely to bore each other to death before they'll ever enter into some sort of Lord of the Flies adventure. Chris Cooper  what is he doing here? He's playing an archetypal father, the one we don't see in "Dead Poets Society," the flipside of his twisted military dad in "American Beauty." James LeGros and Catherine Keener complete the surprising cast. Using a classic college campus  St. Johns, Annapolis -- for a fancy prep school works and heightens the posh effect. The movie doesn't altogether work otherwise. It's energy is sluggish; it has no drive.. But you come back to it looking for something that didn't come together, but might have, because some choice ingredients were there. And won't come this way again.. Check out Haas in "Johns", dated the same year, with David Arquette for another good offbeat role, a wilder, quirkier one that also seems to fit him like a soft old glove. He's never had the role he deserves, but what an actor. James Salter, whose story this is based on, is a very fine writer. The music isn't inappropriate; it's just obtrusively loud, the way schoolboys would play it, if they weren't being properly supervised.

    This flawed film came out of nowhere the other night. We don't know if it ever was released commercially, but it appears to have gone straight to video. As much as we wanted it to be better, "Boys" suffers from a screen play that doesn't fully expand on its characters and leaves us wishing and waiting for more. Stacy Cochran, who adapted the short story by James Salter, sets her story in what appears to be a prep school in New England. This is a school for privileged kids sent by their families to get an education. By having attended this institution will probably ensure the rich boys access to prestige colleges and universities later on. Into this quiet background another darker story happens involving the rich, careless and perhaps promiscuous Patty Vare, who has had a terrible experience when a baseball player takes her on a night ride that is leading to sex, when the car plunges into a river. Patty, who is questioned by the police, is seen riding her horse as the memory of the previous night comes haunting her memory. In attempting a jump over a fence, she and the horse fall and she is hurt. Enter John Baker, a student from the school, who is alerted by another student about the young woman he has found in a field nearby. John decides to take her into his dorm against house rules. They end up going away, ending in the county fair in a night that ends up in a romantic note, but Patty. realizing she wants not to implicate John, disappears. John's parents come to the school and they are helpless to put any sense into his head. That morning Patty and John meet again in the police station. It's clear they have found one another and no one will separate them. The two main roles, Patty and John, are given excellent readings by Winona Ryder and Lukas Haas. Both show great chemistry in their scenes together. Unfortunately, other characters don't fare that well. There is Fenton, who helps Patty escape, whose presence is never justified well. As played by James LeGros, he is an enigma. His girlfriend, Jilly, is acted by Catherine Keener in a role where she is totally wasted. Chris Cooper and Jessica Harper play John's angry parents. The film is not a total failure because of our interest in Patty and John. Perhaps with another director, and a better screen play a better film would have resulted, although Ms. Cochran, and her cinematographer, Robert Elswith, give the production a lovely sheen with the local color of the country in autumn, the county fair seen from a distance, and the staid prep school.

    I watched this at 4 am and I really liked it. It has a certain taboo-younger boy older woman type appeal to it. It was very surreal in content. Which was perfect for my sleep-deprived brain cells. I am a long time fan of lukas haas. I am not a fan of winona. Even she couldn't mess up this role of confused ditsy rich girl who is running from trouble(sic). I would recommend this movie if asked. I would not pay to see it. I thought the story was very far-fetched, but like I said it was surreal and I did get into the movie. It had a very indie-film type feel to it. I was reminded of the movie Girlfriends. Another surreal movie which totally engrossed me around 4 am.

    This movie is underestimated and I'll tell you exactly why: the characters are incredibly realistic, they are searching for something or someone to feel less alone and you could imagine this story really happening. John could have taken the girl to a hospital but he takes her to his room instead just because he feels the need to have something of his own, something no one else knows about. Another aspect about the movie which I can appreciate is the sphere. I cannot explain exactly why, but I was taken away by the beautiful autumn setting and the well chosen soundtrack. There is one scene that might be the best example: the scene in which Jonh wakes up near the fair, you can almost feel the coolness of that autumn morning and can imagine how he feels realizing the girl isn't there anymore and he is all alone once more. This movie in a way, is about how people sometimes just do not want everybody to know everything about them. The girl keeps it a secret what happened to her, the boy does not tell anyone about the girl he found. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the title, I don't understand what "boys" has to do with the story.

    I was skeptical, as many others may have been, before I saw this movie. The idea of a teenager finding a damsel in distress did seem a little immature. However, the simple plot is mapped out very well. The events in this film occur in a logical manner, and as always Lukas and Winona's acting is superb. I even found the secondary characters realistic. This is really one of those movies that keeps on giving. I have seen it about four times over the years, and each time I have caught another subtle detail that made me realize how well this was made. I would not, however, recommend this movie to anyone who must see high action to enjoy a movie. There is quite a bit of dialogue, and you won't hear much noise in the background. And I must comment on the soundtrack, lighting, and clothing of this movie, which really add to the mood. The main characters in this movie both want to escape from their current situations, and I found myself wanting to escape with them. You should definitely catch this one.

Stacy Cochran, who adapted the short story by James Salter, sets her story in what appears to be a prep school in New England. This is a school for privileged kids sent by their families to get an education. By having attended this institution will probably ensure the rich boys access to prestige colleges and universities later on. Into this quiet background another darker story happens involving the rich, careless and perhaps promiscuous Patty Vare, who has had a terrible experience when a baseball player takes her on a night ride that is leading to sex, when the car plunges into a river. Patty, who is questioned by the police, is seen riding her horse as the memory of the previous night comes haunting her memory. In attempting a jump over a fence, she and the horse fall and she is hurt. Enter John Baker, a student from the school, who is alerted by another student about the young woman he has found in a field nearby. John decides to take her into his dorm against house rules. They end up going away, ending in the county fair in a night that ends up in a romantic note, but Patty. realizing she wants not to implicate John, disappears. John's parents come to the school and they are helpless to put any sense into his head. That morning Patty and John meet again in the police station. It's clear they have found one another and no one will separate them. The two main roles, Patty and John, are given excellent readings by Winona Ryder and Lukas Haas. Both show great chemistry in their scenes together. Unfortunately, other characters don't fare that well. There is Fenton, who helps Patty escape, whose presence is never justified well. As played by James LeGros, he is an enigma. His girlfriend, Jilly, is acted by Catherine Keener in a role where she is totally wasted. Chris Cooper and Jessica Harper play John's angry parents. The film is not a total failure because of our interest in Patty and John. Perhaps with another director, and a better screen play a better film would have resulted, although Ms. Cochran, and her cinematographer, Robert Elswith, give the production a lovely sheen with the local color of the country in autumn, the county fair seen from a distance, and the staid prep school.

    I watched this at 4 am and I really liked it. It has a certain taboo-younger boy older woman type appeal to it. It was very surreal in content. Which was perfect for my sleep-deprived brain cells. I am a long time fan of lukas haas. I am not a fan of winona. Even she couldn't mess up this role of confused ditsy rich girl who is running from trouble(sic). I would recommend this movie if asked. I would not pay to see it. I thought the story was very far-fetched, but like I said it was surreal and I did get into the movie. It had a very indie-film type feel to it. I was reminded of the movie Girlfriends. Another surreal movie which totally engrossed me around 4 am.

    This movie is underestimated and I'll tell you exactly why: the characters are incredibly realistic, they are searching for something or someone to feel less alone and you could imagine this story really happening. John could have taken the girl to a hospital but he takes her to his room instead just because he feels the need to have something of his own, something no one else knows about. Another aspect about the movie which I can appreciate is the sphere. I cannot explain exactly why, but I was taken away by the beautiful autumn setting and the well chosen soundtrack. There is one scene that might be the best example: the scene in which Jonh wakes up near the fair, you can almost feel the coolness of that autumn morning and can imagine how he feels realizing the girl isn't there anymore and he is all alone once more. This movie in a way, is about how people sometimes just do not want everybody to know everything about them. The girl keeps it a secret what happened to her, the boy does not tell anyone about the girl he found. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the title, I don't understand what "boys" has to do with the story.

    I was skeptical, as many others may have been, before I saw this movie. The idea of a teenager finding a damsel in distress did seem a little immature. However, the simple plot is mapped out very well. The events in this film occur in a logical manner, and as always Lukas and Winona's acting is superb. I even found the secondary characters realistic. This is really one of those movies that keeps on giving. I have seen it about four times over the years, and each time I have caught another subtle detail that made me realize how well this was made. I would not, however, recommend this movie to anyone who must see high action to enjoy a movie. There is quite a bit of dialogue, and you won't hear much noise in the background. And I must comment on the soundtrack, lighting, and clothing of this movie, which really add to the mood. The main characters in this movie both want to escape from their current situations, and I found myself wanting to escape with them. You should definitely catch this one.

    This was a very good movie. I even enjoyed it being a man, since this type of movies are generally geared towards the female gender. I've actually seen it quiet a few times. Maybe it's because I'm a huge Winona Ryder fan, but in any regards, this film is definitely worth watching. I personally would own it on DVD/Bluray but that's just me. A great film should be owned & added to the person's Movie Library. I think this film probably 1 day will become a classic. Sometimes we miss the obvious classics because there are so many movies that come out all the time, & they make people or at least some people forget what they recently saw. It's nobody's fault, it's just the way it goes. 10/10 for this pleasure of a film.

    I liked this movie. Imagine a teenager, named John, the typical guy who goes to the last year of high school and doesn't quite know what to do with his life. Then, one day, he finds a beautiful woman lying on the floor in a field who, apparently, is on the run for something she did and takes her to his room. It's a boarding school, he might get kicked out, but he doesn't care; he just wants to help her. The look on his face when the woman first wakes up and the teenager walks towards her, is the first sign of a magical performance by Lukas Hass; it's a look that combines the excitement of having this woman in his bed and the curiosity of wanting to know what she might have done. The woman is called Patty Vare, played by the wonderful Winona Ryder in the kind of role she knows by heart but never forgets to add new elements to. Here, besides appearing to be somewhere other than the real world (she fell off a horse before John found her and doesn't remember much), she masters the 'look'; that seductive look only she can achieve and makes anyone go crazy to the point that they would do anything for her. Well, at least that's the effect it had on John in the movieAnd on me, of course. But don't get things wrong. I personally don't think "Boys" is a romantic movie, even if it was writer/director Stacy Cochran's intention. I would call it some kind of an 'age analysis'. Yes, there are romance related moments that make you smile because Winona is an expert on the subject, but this time her character Patty is an expert too: on men. So the study the film tries to make is what can happen when a woman of Patty's experience meets a kid like John in an extreme situation. That's why Cochran shows us flashbacks of what happened to Patty before meeting John; they're necessary for us to know the kind of woman she is. On the other hand, we don't know anything about John but the fact that he has a bad relationship with his father (a respectable Chris Cooper). But we don't need to know, because we realize when he is with Patty; when we hear what he says and see what he does. There's a scene in the town fair, where Patty and John are together in the merry-go-round. The final moment of that scene explains why I liked this movie, and those are the scenes in the movie that work. Not the police sub-plot (led by a convincing John C. Reilly), not John's relationship with his friends at school (although some scenes are good to watch more of Hass' perfect work), not even the conflict with his father. There's another scene really worth paying attention too: a chat in a table where a beautiful light from the window makes Patty seem so vulnerable. Luckily for us, this is a movie where we have the final world; about whether we believe the characters or not and about the inconclusive and far-fetched ending. Yes, it may not honor reality itself, but "Boys" honors its title; and I liked that. I liked this movie.

    I liked this movie a lot. Visually, it is just so appealing in a very mystical sort of way. I don't get why nobody gets this movie. While the story doesn't quite hold up as well as the photography and the ending is way eighties, if you are a poetic person, you will get into this. In a weird sort of way it has a bit of the Love Story appeal. There is just something about it that can't be explained. A lot of the appeal has to do with winona ryder, she has never looked more magnetic...trust me. She actually does a very good acting job with this, in fact she probably saves the movie with her appeal and acting skills. There are certain scenes in this flick that will just float you away...like the one where the two main characters make love in the woods behind the carnival...classic. The first fifteen minutes are very interesting also. To sum up a rambling review just let me say this is one for are searching for something poetic and different in a movie. This is one for the fans of beautiful, sensitive people, falling leaves, and cobblestone paths.

    A young prep school teen(Lukas Haas, quite good)gets involved with a mysterious young woman(Winona Ryder, who doesn't register or emote..not one of her better performances)who has a secret she is hiding. During the film snippets of a past acquaintance(Skeet Ulrich)may answer that very secret. Chris Cooper has a thankless, clich&eacute;d role as profane, short-fused father of Haas. Jessica Harper has the thankless role as Haas' mother, the typical hush-hush-wife afraid of her hot-tempered husband. John C Reilly also has a minor role as a kindly officer trying to locate Ryder over the whereabouts of baseball star Ulrich. The oh-so-big mystery isn't anything to write home about and Ryder is merely a confused dame. The supposed fireworks between Haas and Ryder is non-existent & the film is really unfocused. We get a lot of story on Haas' life in a school for rich annoying kids and with little chemistry between the leads(not to mention a plot which doesn't provide us much in why either would prefer to have such a relationship), there is very little to get excited about. I'd say see the film for Haas' performance, because the rest of this mediocre effort isn't worth your time.

    i started watching this film late one night. i was immediately interested. the music and the tension between the characters was mesmerizing. although some of the characters actions did seem unrealistic. i did not watch the rest of the film until the next evening. all day long, i happily anticipated getting back to this movie. watching the rest of the film was less than satisfying. relationships developed and/or pre-existed without explanation. i was amazed when the credits rolled. i felt a whole chunk of movie had gone missing. i really wanted more from this film. and the potential for being great was there. ryder and haas were intense and had chemistry together. peripheral characters had charisma, others were detestable. then, others seemed pointless. the "problem" in the story did not match the intensity of the mystery in the beginning of the movie. i do not recommend watching this film. there just isn't enough "meat" to make it worthwhile.

    Look, you don't watch every movie because it's a good movie. "Boys"  the title has wandered in from some gay porno flick shopping list -- is for all intents and purposes a bad movie and even nice film critics have been mean to it. But if this is a failure, this is not your average failure. Oh, no. It has moments, and an interesting, borderline cultish, cast. Skeet Ulrich is almost forgotten, but in his fleeting appearances he has a dysfunctional neediness, luminous sex appeal, a scary attraction  you see that also in "As Good As It Gets," where he robs and beats up Greg Kinnear. There's something dangerous  and expendable  about Skeet. We may think of John C. Reilly in PT Anderson's "Magnolia," and see that same homely touching appeal on idle here in his Maryland State Police role. This was probably the only time the mercurial, offbeat Lucas Haas was conventionally cute enough to match up with a pretty -- at times quite beautiful -- girl like Winona. And her dazed, out-of-it quality  she's clearly a young lady who makes nothing but wrong choices in men -- contributes to the curiously touching moments the two have in the amusement park when the high school boy briefly but intensely falls for the 25-year-old and proposes marriage and eternal loyalty and they kiss sweetly and the rest of the world disappears. That's the high point. Now, there's nothing more tedious than the boys in the opening segment nattering at each other, threatening to rat on each other, but curious to get in on any trouble that's going to come downbut the way they behave and look in this movie is completely natural and believable. Like most real schoolboys they're likely to bore each other to death before they'll ever enter into some sort of Lord of the Flies adventure. Chris Cooper  what is he doing here? He's playing an archetypal father, the one we don't see in "Dead Poets Society," the flipside of his twisted military dad in "American Beauty." James LeGros and Catherine Keener complete the surprising cast. Using a classic college campus  St. Johns, Annapolis -- for a fancy prep school works and heightens the posh effect. The movie doesn't altogether work otherwise. It's energy is sluggish; it has no drive.. But you come back to it looking for something that didn't come together, but might have, because some choice ingredients were there. And won't come this way again.. Check out Haas in "Johns", dated the same year, with David Arquette for another good offbeat role, a wilder, quirkier one that also seems to fit him like a soft old glove. He's never had the role he deserves, but what an actor. James Salter, whose story this is based on, is a very fine writer. The music isn't inappropriate; it's just obtrusively loud, the way schoolboys would play it, if they weren't being properly supervised.
