 <sinopse>
  Terry is a suicidal voyeur who treats a dying addict to a final binge, but Terry will only do this if he promises to kill him.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Terry is a suicidal voyeur who doesn't seem to be able to kill himself. While preparing for jumping off a bridge, he meets Nick who ends up saving his life. Terry discovers that Nick is terminally ill and doesn't have much time left. Scared by the lack of time, Nick offers Terry a deal he can't refuse: Terry will become the beneficiary of Nick's life insurance or, since money doesn't matter to Terry, Nick promises to kill him before he dies. All Nick asks is Terry's help to realize a few fantasies before dying.

    This odd movie is completely stolen by a brilliant supporting performance by Kathryn Erbe and once she appears on screen, it's simply her picture. It is a really wonderful piece of work and admirers of her television work will find it a true treat. While she has done some very fine motion picture work, especially memorably in Kiss of Death and Rich in Love, it the tragic-comic turn here that completely overwhelms her fellow cast members. Not a great movie but because of Kathryn Erbe's delightful and moving work, it is well worth your time. Since this review has been judged too short, I would just like to comment that her work in Law and Order: Criminal Intent is excellent and it was quite rewarding indeed to see her give a great performance reprising her role as Eames on some Special Victims Unit episodes. It is truly amazing what she does with that character and she deserved an Emmy for her portrayal of NYPD detective, Alex Eames.

    I've finally had the chance to watch this lost indie gem, having wanted to do it for almost ten years, since I read a brief review about it on a Brazilian magazine. It was worth the wait, and I wish more people had at least heard about this film. Finn Taylor (who recently directed the disappointing "The Darwin Awards") co-wrote and directed the bizarre story of Terry (David Arquette), a suicidal voyeur who's saved by Nick (Brad Hunt), a terminally ill man, as he's about to jump off a bridge. Nick offers Terry a weird deal: Terry will help him realize some fantasies before he dies, and in return, Nick will either make Terry the beneficiary of his life insurance, or... he'll kill Terry. David Arquette is not the comic relief he usually plays, here. His Terry is pathetic, depressed and a little dizzy, but ultimately human and believable. Brad Hunt is a delight to watch as Nick, and it makes you wonder why didn't he become a bigger name. Cathy Moriarty, as Nick's aunt, has one of her best moments since her Oscar nominated d&eacute;but in "Raging Bull" (and I don't even like that performance as much as most people do). The soundtrack is fantastic and eclectic. Even though we've seen similar stories before, the chemistry of Arquette and Hunt and the witty script makes "Dream with the Fishes" quite above the average. 8.5/10.

    I have a special place for this movie, as my father had a bit part in the film as the bartender playing the glasses while David Arquette dances on the bar. my dad passed away exactly one year ago today from cancer, and I wanted to give him a little shout out on here, as this film is indicative of how he spent the last days of his life. Apparently the filmmakers hung out in the bar my dad worked at while they were filming this, and saw him play the glasses as such, and decided to put in the 20 sec scene on a whim. They also got his last name completely wrong in the credits. It's Engel, not Ingalls. But nonetheless, it's a wonderful and moving film that I would recommend highly.

    Terry is suicidal after the death of his wife. Nick is an ailing junkie with only weeks to live. Using Terry's rainy day money they set out on a "vacation" to experience life and go out with a bang, with a promise that Nick will kill Terry at the end of the trip. They end up at the house of Nick's Aunt Elise, Nick tries to make peace with his father, and his girlfriend Liz shows up. While there Terry thinks he won the lottery, only to learn that it was a setup by Nick so that Terry would know what it felt like to win. Meanwhile, Nick's condition worsens. Nick ends up in the hospital and Terry changes his mind about dying. Ironically it's now Terry who helps Nick to die. Terry dumps Nick's ashes in a bay, and we learn the truth about Terry's "wife".

    I was never very fond of David, and just referred to him as Rosanna's goofy brother, but he gives an amazing heart-felt performance, in this, one of the best pictures ever made. This is a wonderful male bonding film, with valuable life lessons, that finds unbridled wildchild Nick(Hunt), who is terminally ill, scams Terry(Arquette) out of committing suicide. Nick lives out his final days with a reckless abandon, dragging the terminally square Terry along for the ride. Along the way, Terry finds the passion to live again. A complete masterpiece! Patrick McGaw, J.E Freeman and Kathryn Erbe were all brilliant in supporting roles, and Brad Hunt was perfectly cast alongside Arquette. Rarely does a film come out that is so compelling, witty, dark and surreal than this gem. Highly recommend to buy rather than rent.

    Dream With The Fishes accomplishes what so many small independent films fail to do: it adheres to the reliable simplicity of storyline and character without getting bogged down in gimmickry or its own cleverness. The casting and performances are perfect - it's a shame that David Arquette has disappeared into his wife's shadow - his performance as self-loathing/suicidal Terry is the perfect foil for Brad Hunt's desperate and free-spirited Nick. Both actors are brilliant in this film yet they've both remained relatively obscure in the years since it's release. Perhaps Finn Taylor's direction has a lot to do with it. Aside from the performances he wrangles from his actors, Dream With The Fishes is also beautifully filmed, from the shots and camera angles to the lighting and even film stock he chooses for different moments to highlight shifts in character and story. Add to this a haunting soundtrack (which I can thank for my introduction to Nick Drake) and you have a charming, heart-breaking, inspiring ride that serves both as an entertaining couple of hours viewing and a fine example for aspiring filmmakers.

    I just wanted to take the time to let people know this movie is a hidden treasure. The performances are fantastic. The script is first rate and the direction couldn't have been better. Although I know David Arquette isn't a great actor, I still think he did a great job playing the quirky suicidal character that really only needs someone to love him. Brad Hunt is very realistic as the dying friend who teaches David how to live life to the fullest. Finn Taylor is quite a talent. The way he mixes comedy and drama is something I hadn't seen in quite some time. I truly felt the deep friendship the two main characters had. The nude bowling scene was funny but the acid laced cop in a donut shop was flat out hysterical. Please give this movie a chance. It moved me.

    Surprisingly, this was a great movie. I didn't think I'd like it, but I loved it. It has its weird moments, but generally, it was good. Brad Hunt as Nick was incredible (not to mention hot!). Who the hell is Brad Hunt? I've never even heard of him until now. This movie makes me want to check out his other movies. He's a great actor. David Arquette was great as usual. Nick (Brad Hunt) and Terry (David Arquette) make such a unique friendship. That's what draws me to this movie. Their friendship is really cool. They turn into best friends. That was great. There are many unexpecting things that happen. I don't wanna ruin the end, but lets just say its a tearjerker. Definitely worth watching.

    The rollercoaster ride taken by characters Nick (Brad Hunt) and Terry (David Arquette) during Dream With the Fishes is fittingly analogous to this inconsistent yet quirky film. Both main characters demonstrate flashes of brilliant acting as they plunge into the depths of a suicidal binge fueled by Terry's desire to die and Nick's desire to squeeze whatever he can out of his last few weeks of life. These contrasts play well throughout the first half of the film. Particularly memorable are the scenes where Nick goes naked bowling with strippers and Terry practically wets himself when one of Nick's bowling partners makes a pass at him. What makes this relationship work is the balance between the two characters. Terry's fearful hesitance is matched by Nick's unflinching charisma and willingness to abandon rational convention. In the second half of the film, however, the catharsis's of both main characters take some hyperbolic turns. Although Brad Hunt does well in the first half of the film at playing Terry in a way that is realistically eccentric, his acting in the second half seems to cross over the line of believable characterization. Hunt's portrayal seems a little too calculated and lacks the complete spontaneity that makes Nick an enjoyable character in the first half of the film. His responses to Nick's change of attitude seem almost too familiar as the crazy guy who straddles the line between selfish indulger and selfless mentor. Despite these flaws, the film maintains its duality as a funny yet though provoking window into two mens eccentric experiences as they deal with the realities of life and death.

    Dreams with the Fishes, is a film that will only be appreciated by those that have have the time to sit and think about life, its meanings and what do we really want / need as individuals. It manages to address so many issues and identifies the many human characteristics in all of us that make us annoying, frail, funny and kind. This film is so much more than a comedy, it is a unique entity that manages to do so many things where others fail. A shoe string budget and not big actors but this adds to its perfection. A must see, a must buy for collectors looking for something different. Will leave you gob smacked... Such a shame it isn't available on DVD.

    Terry is suicidal after the death of his wife. Nick is an ailing junkie with only weeks to live. Using Terry's rainy day money they set out on a "vacation" to experience life and go out with a bang, with a promise that Nick will kill Terry at the end of the trip. They end up at the house of Nick's Aunt Elise, Nick tries to make peace with his father, and his girlfriend Liz shows up. While there Terry thinks he won the lottery, only to learn that it was a setup by Nick so that Terry would know what it felt like to win. Meanwhile, Nick's condition worsens. Nick ends up in the hospital and Terry changes his mind about dying. Ironically it's now Terry who helps Nick to die. Terry dumps Nick's ashes in a bay, and we learn the truth about Terry's "wife".

    I was never very fond of David, and just referred to him as Rosanna's goofy brother, but he gives an amazing heart-felt performance, in this, one of the best pictures ever made. This is a wonderful male bonding film, with valuable life lessons, that finds unbridled wildchild Nick(Hunt), who is terminally ill, scams Terry(Arquette) out of committing suicide. Nick lives out his final days with a reckless abandon, dragging the terminally square Terry along for the ride. Along the way, Terry finds the passion to live again. A complete masterpiece! Patrick McGaw, J.E Freeman and Kathryn Erbe were all brilliant in supporting roles, and Brad Hunt was perfectly cast alongside Arquette. Rarely does a film come out that is so compelling, witty, dark and surreal than this gem. Highly recommend to buy rather than rent.

    Dream With The Fishes accomplishes what so many small independent films fail to do: it adheres to the reliable simplicity of storyline and character without getting bogged down in gimmickry or its own cleverness. The casting and performances are perfect - it's a shame that David Arquette has disappeared into his wife's shadow - his performance as self-loathing/suicidal Terry is the perfect foil for Brad Hunt's desperate and free-spirited Nick. Both actors are brilliant in this film yet they've both remained relatively obscure in the years since it's release. Perhaps Finn Taylor's direction has a lot to do with it. Aside from the performances he wrangles from his actors, Dream With The Fishes is also beautifully filmed, from the shots and camera angles to the lighting and even film stock he chooses for different moments to highlight shifts in character and story. Add to this a haunting soundtrack (which I can thank for my introduction to Nick Drake) and you have a charming, heart-breaking, inspiring ride that serves both as an entertaining couple of hours viewing and a fine example for aspiring filmmakers.

    I just wanted to take the time to let people know this movie is a hidden treasure. The performances are fantastic. The script is first rate and the direction couldn't have been better. Although I know David Arquette isn't a great actor, I still think he did a great job playing the quirky suicidal character that really only needs someone to love him. Brad Hunt is very realistic as the dying friend who teaches David how to live life to the fullest. Finn Taylor is quite a talent. The way he mixes comedy and drama is something I hadn't seen in quite some time. I truly felt the deep friendship the two main characters had. The nude bowling scene was funny but the acid laced cop in a donut shop was flat out hysterical. Please give this movie a chance. It moved me.

    Surprisingly, this was a great movie. I didn't think I'd like it, but I loved it. It has its weird moments, but generally, it was good. Brad Hunt as Nick was incredible (not to mention hot!). Who the hell is Brad Hunt? I've never even heard of him until now. This movie makes me want to check out his other movies. He's a great actor. David Arquette was great as usual. Nick (Brad Hunt) and Terry (David Arquette) make such a unique friendship. That's what draws me to this movie. Their friendship is really cool. They turn into best friends. That was great. There are many unexpecting things that happen. I don't wanna ruin the end, but lets just say its a tearjerker. Definitely worth watching.

    The rollercoaster ride taken by characters Nick (Brad Hunt) and Terry (David Arquette) during Dream With the Fishes is fittingly analogous to this inconsistent yet quirky film. Both main characters demonstrate flashes of brilliant acting as they plunge into the depths of a suicidal binge fueled by Terry's desire to die and Nick's desire to squeeze whatever he can out of his last few weeks of life. These contrasts play well throughout the first half of the film. Particularly memorable are the scenes where Nick goes naked bowling with strippers and Terry practically wets himself when one of Nick's bowling partners makes a pass at him. What makes this relationship work is the balance between the two characters. Terry's fearful hesitance is matched by Nick's unflinching charisma and willingness to abandon rational convention. In the second half of the film, however, the catharsis's of both main characters take some hyperbolic turns. Although Brad Hunt does well in the first half of the film at playing Terry in a way that is realistically eccentric, his acting in the second half seems to cross over the line of believable characterization. Hunt's portrayal seems a little too calculated and lacks the complete spontaneity that makes Nick an enjoyable character in the first half of the film. His responses to Nick's change of attitude seem almost too familiar as the crazy guy who straddles the line between selfish indulger and selfless mentor. Despite these flaws, the film maintains its duality as a funny yet though provoking window into two mens eccentric experiences as they deal with the realities of life and death.

    Dreams with the Fishes, is a film that will only be appreciated by those that have have the time to sit and think about life, its meanings and what do we really want / need as individuals. It manages to address so many issues and identifies the many human characteristics in all of us that make us annoying, frail, funny and kind. This film is so much more than a comedy, it is a unique entity that manages to do so many things where others fail. A shoe string budget and not big actors but this adds to its perfection. A must see, a must buy for collectors looking for something different. Will leave you gob smacked... Such a shame it isn't available on DVD.
