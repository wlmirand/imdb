 <sinopse>
  A couple's big dreams give way to a life full of unexpected sadness and unexpected joy.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  As Julie prepares to leave her husband Roger, she begins to play through a stack of recordings, each of which reminds her of events in their lives together. One of them is the song that was playing when she and Roger first met in a music store. Other songs remind her of their courtship, their marriage, their desire for a child, and the joys and sorrows that they have shared. A flood of memories comes back to her as she ponders their present problems and how they arose.

    RCA Victor could have subsidized this Columbia release. It looks as if by 1941 the only recording company in business was RCA, for every single disc Irene Dunne plays for almost two hours, during this over sentimental account of a couple searching for a child, is on that label. George Stevens' film starts promisingly but becomes dull with its structure device (every time Dunne plays a record, she remembers a stage of her married life), and very silly with cute babies and smiling little girls, that the whole product loses impact. Dunne and Cary Grant are good as usual, but Grant has more opportunity to elaborate a performance, and Dunne has little opportunity to display her winning charm; while Beulah Bondi and Edgar Kennedy provide excellent support in key roles. These four performances make the film somehow worthwhile, but for me that was just it.

    First and foremost, the idea of telling the whole movie through flashback was brilliant. Every record represented a different time and brought back significant memories. The wipe with in the record to the next scene was a bit awkward sometimes, but it was 1941. The movie was actually quite good but the ending was very off putting. I wouldn't say it ruined my entire experience, but it certainly came close. I was right with these characters the entire time until the writer decided to "jump to shark". It is a happy ending but definitely not realistic. Their solution to the problem was more suited to replacing the family dog, not their child.

    This was a phenomenal movie. I loved the way they portrayed the struggles of a couple who are raising their first child. George Stevens does a wonderful job directing this. If any other director tried to do what he did, the film would be a miserable tear jerker. It's unfortunate how realistic this movie really was, but yet it ends happily which is exactly how people needed their movies to end in the 40s. George Stevens really attempted to compose this film with a lot of respect to the narrative. The story here was more important than the actual film making. There are many flaws and cheap screw ups, but that's not something the audience is looking for. It's an emotional, happy, drama, and it doesn't matter how bad the movie is made quality wise. It was made badly though, it just had some flaws.

    Penny Serenade is basically the movie version of life for people. Love is pressed into the wall by problems both internal and external. Their attempts to create a family was staring to crumble and left them on the verge of divorce. This movie tend to be magnificent when it comes to showing these problems and how the couple try to handle them together, even though it affects their relationship. The emotion really shows between the two and the facts about marriage are proved quite true by their actions. The movie itself seems interesting in the black and white format and if yo have not seen this film or ever wanted to see it again, do so now!

    Cary Grant is one of my favorite actors of the twentieth century, and thus, it is difficult to give this film a bad review. It is not that it was poorly made or the actors were inadequate, but I think the storyline used nostalgic sentiment as a sort of crutch to move along, and that often happened quite slowly. The use of flashback is well done, but seemingly overplayed. The photography in the film was not really above-average, but I also don't have any complaints with it. I suppose if nothing else, Penny Serenade is a perfect example of how pace and editing can make or break a movie, and for me, it didn't quite make it.

    this movie was very cute but also very sad, this poor couple is very much in love and want nothing more then to have children to love as well. but there's nothing but disater for them when they loss there unborn child in a earthquake, then finally able to adopt a little girl and go through so much just to keep her only for her to fall ill and die. this tears them apart and they almost split up when they get a call that there is a two year old boy that they can adopt and they are so over joyed that all the pain they felt moments before almost vanish. some of my favorite scene's where when they first bring there baby girl home they are trying to be quite but the stairs creek and just the angle of the camera and the look on there faces as they run up the stairs so not to wake the baby is just precious.

    this movie was very unusual story but also sad. The fast marriage then adopting the baby (Trina), to fill that gap in the marriage, then finally the loss of her. this movie did not really keep my attention it seemed to drag on which is a turn off for me. the editing in the movie had some glitch's it seemed to jump or hesitate, though they are not that noticeable. Another thing I saw the lighting seemed to bright in a couple of scenes, and yes it is black and white but when there is to much light, it makes it easier to notice because there is not the other colors to blend into. Over all it was interesting movie again dragging at some parts, but its plot was quite complex and sad.

    This whole movie is full of disappointments and sorrow, it follows the trouble of Julie and Roger Adams who are constantly screwed in life's journey. The movie is black and white but has a very clear picture and pretty good sound quality for a 1941 film. The movie is shot mostly indoor so the lighting is adequate. The only complaint that I have for the movie is that it's two hours long. It's a little drawn out and doesn't really need the whole two hours that it fills up. Some scenes could definitely be pulled out so that the film is easier to sit through in one sitting. Overall I rated the film an 8 out of 10 because it's a very sad and developed story, the only complaint that I have is the length of the film.

    With a well organized story line and a decent amount of sympathy this film comes across to me as the ever so common love story. Most of this is due to the fact that a movie like this one comes to theaters about 5 times a year now a days, but put in perspective of the early 1940's and you got yourself a film with quite uniqueness. The amount of over dramatic scenes was found a bit to often but again compared to movies today it was a nothing out of the ordinary. I'd have to say the actors sold their roles and were very believable. Now what made this film different from many of the films out there was the way Dunne went through all the flashback scenes in the movie by playing records that reminded her of their life together. It was a very strong idea that got the concept across fairly easily.

    There is no doubt in my mind that any movie that uses old music to flash back to the points of importance in any story will be an interesting one. Old music has been often used to explore emotions in movies, and "Penny Serenade" is probably the first to do it so well. The story starts as wife Irene Dunne is about to leave husband Cary Grant, feeling that they just don't need each other anymore. Listening to "You Were Meant For Me", she flashes back to when they first met, how he bought 27 records (not even having a record player) just to meet her. They begin dating, and on New Year's Eve, he proposes. They end up in Japan where a horrendous earthquake brings on tragedy with grave consequences, leading them to decide to adopt a child. Thanks to understanding adoption agent Beulah Bondi, they end up with a baby girl, which leads to an amusing scene where Dunne gets frustrated while the neighbors and Grant's employees from his small newspaper watch her bathe and feed the child. "Petticoat Junction's" Edgar Buchannan is Grant's kindly Uncle Apple Jack, who is their emotional support in times of trouble. Excellent writing makes this drama touching, featuring many comic moments, not surprising considering that Grant and Dunne were in "The Awful Truth", one of the best screwball comedies of the 1930's. After divorcing and finding each other again in that movie, Grant and Dunne explore every aspect of a typical marriage. Having just made "Love Affair" (later re-made with Grant in the role played by Charles Boyer), Dunne was hot, and along with Myrna Loy and Claudette Colbert, represented what America deemed "the perfect wife and mother to come home to". Of the dozens of films she made, many of them were later re-made, but not "Penny Serenade". You can't improve on perfection. Another famous sequence is the Christmas pageant where their young daughter Trina does double duty as a stage hand (moving clouds and stars) and singing a solo of "Silent Night" as an echo. This sequence, a favorite among Christmas movie buffs, leads into the dramatic finale that transitions the film from light comedy to tear-jerking drama which ultimately leads into a triumphant finale for Grant and Dunne with Bondi (as she is once described) as a fairy godmother of sorts.

    this movie was very cute but also very sad, this poor couple is very much in love and want nothing more then to have children to love as well. but there's nothing but disater for them when they loss there unborn child in a earthquake, then finally able to adopt a little girl and go through so much just to keep her only for her to fall ill and die. this tears them apart and they almost split up when they get a call that there is a two year old boy that they can adopt and they are so over joyed that all the pain they felt moments before almost vanish. some of my favorite scene's where when they first bring there baby girl home they are trying to be quite but the stairs creek and just the angle of the camera and the look on there faces as they run up the stairs so not to wake the baby is just precious.

    this movie was very unusual story but also sad. The fast marriage then adopting the baby (Trina), to fill that gap in the marriage, then finally the loss of her. this movie did not really keep my attention it seemed to drag on which is a turn off for me. the editing in the movie had some glitch's it seemed to jump or hesitate, though they are not that noticeable. Another thing I saw the lighting seemed to bright in a couple of scenes, and yes it is black and white but when there is to much light, it makes it easier to notice because there is not the other colors to blend into. Over all it was interesting movie again dragging at some parts, but its plot was quite complex and sad.

    This whole movie is full of disappointments and sorrow, it follows the trouble of Julie and Roger Adams who are constantly screwed in life's journey. The movie is black and white but has a very clear picture and pretty good sound quality for a 1941 film. The movie is shot mostly indoor so the lighting is adequate. The only complaint that I have for the movie is that it's two hours long. It's a little drawn out and doesn't really need the whole two hours that it fills up. Some scenes could definitely be pulled out so that the film is easier to sit through in one sitting. Overall I rated the film an 8 out of 10 because it's a very sad and developed story, the only complaint that I have is the length of the film.

    With a well organized story line and a decent amount of sympathy this film comes across to me as the ever so common love story. Most of this is due to the fact that a movie like this one comes to theaters about 5 times a year now a days, but put in perspective of the early 1940's and you got yourself a film with quite uniqueness. The amount of over dramatic scenes was found a bit to often but again compared to movies today it was a nothing out of the ordinary. I'd have to say the actors sold their roles and were very believable. Now what made this film different from many of the films out there was the way Dunne went through all the flashback scenes in the movie by playing records that reminded her of their life together. It was a very strong idea that got the concept across fairly easily.

    There is no doubt in my mind that any movie that uses old music to flash back to the points of importance in any story will be an interesting one. Old music has been often used to explore emotions in movies, and "Penny Serenade" is probably the first to do it so well. The story starts as wife Irene Dunne is about to leave husband Cary Grant, feeling that they just don't need each other anymore. Listening to "You Were Meant For Me", she flashes back to when they first met, how he bought 27 records (not even having a record player) just to meet her. They begin dating, and on New Year's Eve, he proposes. They end up in Japan where a horrendous earthquake brings on tragedy with grave consequences, leading them to decide to adopt a child. Thanks to understanding adoption agent Beulah Bondi, they end up with a baby girl, which leads to an amusing scene where Dunne gets frustrated while the neighbors and Grant's employees from his small newspaper watch her bathe and feed the child. "Petticoat Junction's" Edgar Buchannan is Grant's kindly Uncle Apple Jack, who is their emotional support in times of trouble. Excellent writing makes this drama touching, featuring many comic moments, not surprising considering that Grant and Dunne were in "The Awful Truth", one of the best screwball comedies of the 1930's. After divorcing and finding each other again in that movie, Grant and Dunne explore every aspect of a typical marriage. Having just made "Love Affair" (later re-made with Grant in the role played by Charles Boyer), Dunne was hot, and along with Myrna Loy and Claudette Colbert, represented what America deemed "the perfect wife and mother to come home to". Of the dozens of films she made, many of them were later re-made, but not "Penny Serenade". You can't improve on perfection. Another famous sequence is the Christmas pageant where their young daughter Trina does double duty as a stage hand (moving clouds and stars) and singing a solo of "Silent Night" as an echo. This sequence, a favorite among Christmas movie buffs, leads into the dramatic finale that transitions the film from light comedy to tear-jerking drama which ultimately leads into a triumphant finale for Grant and Dunne with Bondi (as she is once described) as a fairy godmother of sorts.

    RCA Victor could have subsidized this Columbia release. It looks as if by 1941 the only recording company in business was RCA, for every single disc Irene Dunne plays for almost two hours, during this over sentimental account of a couple searching for a child, is on that label. George Stevens' film starts promisingly but becomes dull with its structure device (every time Dunne plays a record, she remembers a stage of her married life), and very silly with cute babies and smiling little girls, that the whole product loses impact. Dunne and Cary Grant are good as usual, but Grant has more opportunity to elaborate a performance, and Dunne has little opportunity to display her winning charm; while Beulah Bondi and Edgar Kennedy provide excellent support in key roles. These four performances make the film somehow worthwhile, but for me that was just it.

    First and foremost, the idea of telling the whole movie through flashback was brilliant. Every record represented a different time and brought back significant memories. The wipe with in the record to the next scene was a bit awkward sometimes, but it was 1941. The movie was actually quite good but the ending was very off putting. I wouldn't say it ruined my entire experience, but it certainly came close. I was right with these characters the entire time until the writer decided to "jump to shark". It is a happy ending but definitely not realistic. Their solution to the problem was more suited to replacing the family dog, not their child.

    This was a phenomenal movie. I loved the way they portrayed the struggles of a couple who are raising their first child. George Stevens does a wonderful job directing this. If any other director tried to do what he did, the film would be a miserable tear jerker. It's unfortunate how realistic this movie really was, but yet it ends happily which is exactly how people needed their movies to end in the 40s. George Stevens really attempted to compose this film with a lot of respect to the narrative. The story here was more important than the actual film making. There are many flaws and cheap screw ups, but that's not something the audience is looking for. It's an emotional, happy, drama, and it doesn't matter how bad the movie is made quality wise. It was made badly though, it just had some flaws.

    Penny Serenade is basically the movie version of life for people. Love is pressed into the wall by problems both internal and external. Their attempts to create a family was staring to crumble and left them on the verge of divorce. This movie tend to be magnificent when it comes to showing these problems and how the couple try to handle them together, even though it affects their relationship. The emotion really shows between the two and the facts about marriage are proved quite true by their actions. The movie itself seems interesting in the black and white format and if yo have not seen this film or ever wanted to see it again, do so now!

    Cary Grant is one of my favorite actors of the twentieth century, and thus, it is difficult to give this film a bad review. It is not that it was poorly made or the actors were inadequate, but I think the storyline used nostalgic sentiment as a sort of crutch to move along, and that often happened quite slowly. The use of flashback is well done, but seemingly overplayed. The photography in the film was not really above-average, but I also don't have any complaints with it. I suppose if nothing else, Penny Serenade is a perfect example of how pace and editing can make or break a movie, and for me, it didn't quite make it.

The wipe with in the record to the next scene was a bit awkward sometimes, but it was 1941. The movie was actually quite good but the ending was very off putting. I wouldn't say it ruined my entire experience, but it certainly came close. I was right with these characters the entire time until the writer decided to "jump to shark". It is a happy ending but definitely not realistic. Their solution to the problem was more suited to replacing the family dog, not their child.

    This was a phenomenal movie. I loved the way they portrayed the struggles of a couple who are raising their first child. George Stevens does a wonderful job directing this. If any other director tried to do what he did, the film would be a miserable tear jerker. It's unfortunate how realistic this movie really was, but yet it ends happily which is exactly how people needed their movies to end in the 40s. George Stevens really attempted to compose this film with a lot of respect to the narrative. The story here was more important than the actual film making. There are many flaws and cheap screw ups, but that's not something the audience is looking for. It's an emotional, happy, drama, and it doesn't matter how bad the movie is made quality wise. It was made badly though, it just had some flaws.

    Penny Serenade is basically the movie version of life for people. Love is pressed into the wall by problems both internal and external. Their attempts to create a family was staring to crumble and left them on the verge of divorce. This movie tend to be magnificent when it comes to showing these problems and how the couple try to handle them together, even though it affects their relationship. The emotion really shows between the two and the facts about marriage are proved quite true by their actions. The movie itself seems interesting in the black and white format and if yo have not seen this film or ever wanted to see it again, do so now!

    Cary Grant is one of my favorite actors of the twentieth century, and thus, it is difficult to give this film a bad review. It is not that it was poorly made or the actors were inadequate, but I think the storyline used nostalgic sentiment as a sort of crutch to move along, and that often happened quite slowly. The use of flashback is well done, but seemingly overplayed. The photography in the film was not really above-average, but I also don't have any complaints with it. I suppose if nothing else, Penny Serenade is a perfect example of how pace and editing can make or break a movie, and for me, it didn't quite make it.

    this movie was very cute but also very sad, this poor couple is very much in love and want nothing more then to have children to love as well. but there's nothing but disater for them when they loss there unborn child in a earthquake, then finally able to adopt a little girl and go through so much just to keep her only for her to fall ill and die. this tears them apart and they almost split up when they get a call that there is a two year old boy that they can adopt and they are so over joyed that all the pain they felt moments before almost vanish. some of my favorite scene's where when they first bring there baby girl home they are trying to be quite but the stairs creek and just the angle of the camera and the look on there faces as they run up the stairs so not to wake the baby is just precious.

    this movie was very unusual story but also sad. The fast marriage then adopting the baby (Trina), to fill that gap in the marriage, then finally the loss of her. this movie did not really keep my attention it seemed to drag on which is a turn off for me. the editing in the movie had some glitch's it seemed to jump or hesitate, though they are not that noticeable. Another thing I saw the lighting seemed to bright in a couple of scenes, and yes it is black and white but when there is to much light, it makes it easier to notice because there is not the other colors to blend into. Over all it was interesting movie again dragging at some parts, but its plot was quite complex and sad.

    This whole movie is full of disappointments and sorrow, it follows the trouble of Julie and Roger Adams who are constantly screwed in life's journey. The movie is black and white but has a very clear picture and pretty good sound quality for a 1941 film. The movie is shot mostly indoor so the lighting is adequate. The only complaint that I have for the movie is that it's two hours long. It's a little drawn out and doesn't really need the whole two hours that it fills up. Some scenes could definitely be pulled out so that the film is easier to sit through in one sitting. Overall I rated the film an 8 out of 10 because it's a very sad and developed story, the only complaint that I have is the length of the film.

    With a well organized story line and a decent amount of sympathy this film comes across to me as the ever so common love story. Most of this is due to the fact that a movie like this one comes to theaters about 5 times a year now a days, but put in perspective of the early 1940's and you got yourself a film with quite uniqueness. The amount of over dramatic scenes was found a bit to often but again compared to movies today it was a nothing out of the ordinary. I'd have to say the actors sold their roles and were very believable. Now what made this film different from many of the films out there was the way Dunne went through all the flashback scenes in the movie by playing records that reminded her of their life together. It was a very strong idea that got the concept across fairly easily.

    There is no doubt in my mind that any movie that uses old music to flash back to the points of importance in any story will be an interesting one. Old music has been often used to explore emotions in movies, and "Penny Serenade" is probably the first to do it so well. The story starts as wife Irene Dunne is about to leave husband Cary Grant, feeling that they just don't need each other anymore. Listening to "You Were Meant For Me", she flashes back to when they first met, how he bought 27 records (not even having a record player) just to meet her. They begin dating, and on New Year's Eve, he proposes. They end up in Japan where a horrendous earthquake brings on tragedy with grave consequences, leading them to decide to adopt a child. Thanks to understanding adoption agent Beulah Bondi, they end up with a baby girl, which leads to an amusing scene where Dunne gets frustrated while the neighbors and Grant's employees from his small newspaper watch her bathe and feed the child. "Petticoat Junction's" Edgar Buchannan is Grant's kindly Uncle Apple Jack, who is their emotional support in times of trouble. Excellent writing makes this drama touching, featuring many comic moments, not surprising considering that Grant and Dunne were in "The Awful Truth", one of the best screwball comedies of the 1930's. After divorcing and finding each other again in that movie, Grant and Dunne explore every aspect of a typical marriage. Having just made "Love Affair" (later re-made with Grant in the role played by Charles Boyer), Dunne was hot, and along with Myrna Loy and Claudette Colbert, represented what America deemed "the perfect wife and mother to come home to". Of the dozens of films she made, many of them were later re-made, but not "Penny Serenade". You can't improve on perfection. Another famous sequence is the Christmas pageant where their young daughter Trina does double duty as a stage hand (moving clouds and stars) and singing a solo of "Silent Night" as an echo. This sequence, a favorite among Christmas movie buffs, leads into the dramatic finale that transitions the film from light comedy to tear-jerking drama which ultimately leads into a triumphant finale for Grant and Dunne with Bondi (as she is once described) as a fairy godmother of sorts.

    RCA Victor could have subsidized this Columbia release. It looks as if by 1941 the only recording company in business was RCA, for every single disc Irene Dunne plays for almost two hours, during this over sentimental account of a couple searching for a child, is on that label. George Stevens' film starts promisingly but becomes dull with its structure device (every time Dunne plays a record, she remembers a stage of her married life), and very silly with cute babies and smiling little girls, that the whole product loses impact. Dunne and Cary Grant are good as usual, but Grant has more opportunity to elaborate a performance, and Dunne has little opportunity to display her winning charm; while Beulah Bondi and Edgar Kennedy provide excellent support in key roles. These four performances make the film somehow worthwhile, but for me that was just it.

    There is no doubt in my mind that any movie that uses old music to flash back to the points of importance in any story will be an interesting one. Old music has been often used to explore emotions in movies, and "Penny Serenade" is probably the first to do it so well. The story starts as wife Irene Dunne is about to leave husband Cary Grant, feeling that they just don't need each other anymore. Listening to "You Were Meant For Me", she flashes back to when they first met, how he bought 27 records (not even having a record player) just to meet her. They begin dating, and on New Year's Eve, he proposes. They end up in Japan where a horrendous earthquake brings on tragedy with grave consequences, leading them to decide to adopt a child. Thanks to understanding adoption agent Beulah Bondi, they end up with a baby girl, which leads to an amusing scene where Dunne gets frustrated while the neighbors and Grant's employees from his small newspaper watch her bathe and feed the child. "Petticoat Junction's" Edgar Buchannan is Grant's kindly Uncle Apple Jack, who is their emotional support in times of trouble. Excellent writing makes this drama touching, featuring many comic moments, not surprising considering that Grant and Dunne were in "The Awful Truth", one of the best screwball comedies of the 1930's. After divorcing and finding each other again in that movie, Grant and Dunne explore every aspect of a typical marriage. Having just made "Love Affair" (later re-made with Grant in the role played by Charles Boyer), Dunne was hot, and along with Myrna Loy and Claudette Colbert, represented what America deemed "the perfect wife and mother to come home to". Of the dozens of films she made, many of them were later re-made, but not "Penny Serenade". You can't improve on perfection. Another famous sequence is the Christmas pageant where their young daughter Trina does double duty as a stage hand (moving clouds and stars) and singing a solo of "Silent Night" as an echo. This sequence, a favorite among Christmas movie buffs, leads into the dramatic finale that transitions the film from light comedy to tear-jerking drama which ultimately leads into a triumphant finale for Grant and Dunne with Bondi (as she is once described) as a fairy godmother of sorts.
