    Adjectives such as compelling, suspenseful, mesmerizing, and haunting all apply with equal relevance to director Barry Levinson's serious-minded, tour de force tale of vengeance "Sleepers," starring Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patric, and Brad Pitt. The title comes from the street name for boys who have done time in juvenile lock-ups. Exploitative and depressing as the subject matter remains, "Sleepers" never stoops to vile instincts. Serving as his own scenarist, Levinson has woven an intricately designed yarn that unfurls like a Biblical epic. "Sleepers" charts the dire course of events when a winsome quartet of boys leaves the innocence of adolescence behind and plunges headlong into the fully blown evils of adulthood. Mind you, nothing lurid occurs on-screen. Compared with the Burt Reynolds & Jon Voight wilderness thriller "Deliverance," "Sleepers" seems almost tame in its depiction of evil. What takes place off-screen in this polished, downbeat film is what may disturb you. Adapted from Lorenzo Carcanterra's bestseller, "Sleepers' opens with a quaint bit of nostalgia. Audiences meet Lorenzo (Joe Perrino), Michael (Brad Renfro), John (Geoff Wigdor) and Tommy (Jonathan Tucker) and observe their lives in the tightly-knit sanctuary of New York City's Hell's Kitchen. Unspeakable horror derails the nostalgia and shatters their lives forever. Initially, Levinson appears to imitate Martin Scorsese. The film spans the late 1960s up the early 1970s as we follow the mischievous deeds of the four boys roaming those urban mean streets. Father Bobby (Robert De Niro of "Taxi Driver") is the sympathetic Catholic priest who befriends the boys and becomes their live-long confidant. One hot summer day, these reckless teens dream up a prank that nearly kills an innocent bystander. The court sentences them to a year in the Wilkinson Home of Boys reformatory. Before they've been locked up an hour, our protagonists realize the tragic mistake that they have made. They are beyond the protective confines of Hell's Kitchen and have fallen into a different kind of Hell. Sadistic guards led by smiling Sean Noyes (Kevin Bacon of "Footloose") prey on these defenseless minors. They rape and sodomize them on a regular basis in the dark cellars beneath the reformatory. Two of the four emerge the worse for their experiences. John Reilly (Ron Eldard of "Drop Dead Fred") and Tommy Marcano (Billy Crudup of "Watchmen") turn into armed and deadly street hoodlums who deal narcotics and act as assassins. Lorenzo (Jason Patric) and Michael (Brad Pitt) take the high road. One winds up at a newspaper while the other lands a post in the district attorney's office. The years elapse. One night John and Tommy spot Noyes in a neighborhood restaurant. After they refresh Noyes' memory, they gun him down in cold blood. When they are arrested for murder, childhood pal Michael volunteers to prosecute them. Witnesses can place them at the scene of the homicide, but the attorney decides to tip the scales of justice. Lorenzo and he contrive an elaborate scheme not only to win freedom for their friends but also pay back the despicable guard. Some critics have complained that Kevin Bacon's demise half-way through the story qualifies as anti-climactic. Nonsense! "Sleepers" concerns friendship and how these friends with an entire community conspire to save John and Tommy. "Sleepers" invokes the vigilante justice formula of the recent John Grisham movie "A Time to Kill" in condoning the clear-cut murder of a repugnant individual. Director Barry Levinson has helmed several impressive films, but none compare with the hard-edged, clinical fatalism of this epic. "Sleepers" amounts to a stroll on the seamy side for the director of movies such as "Tin Men," "Rain Man," "Diner," "The Natural," "Bugsy," and "Disclosure." Meanwhile, "Sleepers' wallows in the ironic half-light of an amoral universe. Nevertheless, "Sleepers" is pure Levinson, from its 1960s era setting to the camaraderie of its leads. Levinson has fashioned a literate screenplay. During the first hour, he sets up his characters and explores the insular community of Hell's Kitchen. Everything here foreshadows the events which follows Noyes' murder. Levinson's tragedy is not so much about exorcising demons from their past as it is about heading off another catastrophe. Wisely, Levinson tones down the charisma that distinguishes his stellar cast of heartthrobs. As the shrewd assistant district attorney who orchestrates the cover-up in court, Pitt appears commendably taciturn though frayed in his shady effort to win justice for his childhood friends. Jason Patric is just guarded in his attitude but just as vindictive. Michael and Lorenzo both live out a vengeful fantasy as much a part of their Hell's Kitchen heritage as it is the Alexander Dumas novel "The Count of Monte Cristo" that he learned to savor at Wilkinson. Kevin Bacon endows his abusive prison guard with a cheerful decadence. You'll despise Bacon's depraved sentinel who is determined to teach his juvenile charges about rules and discipline. As Noyes' closet-cohort Ferguson, Terry Kinny has a devastating scene in court when he confesses his part in molesting these young men. Despite his short-time on screen, Dustin Hoffman dominates the action as an alcoholic, skid-row attorney who doubts his ability to acquit his guilty-as-sin clients. As stunning as "Sleepers" is, you may shy away from the experiencing its gritty realism more than once. Whether you skulk out of the movie feeling like a grimy, morally-bankrupt conspirator or trudge away from it with a world full of cynicism, you may have a difficult time either shrugging off or dismissing this evocative film.

    Sleepers is divided into two quite heterogeneous parts, where events are related in a rather heavy way by a continuous voice over, and through a direction that lacks a bit of ambition and that is sometimes too schmaltzy (emphatic shots, sad soundtrack). The first part is dark and terrifying with this gut-wrenching and poignant story that unfortunately certainly must have occurred more than once. The second part however struggles a bit more and is often a bit lengthy, despite some excellent scenes, mainly the ones at the courthouse. Most importantly, the vengeance scheme and the trial seem very far-fetched and very little credible, therefore inducing strong doubts about their veracity. As for the cast, it isn't as impressive as one could have thought in the first place. Apart from the excellent Kevin Bacon, no one really stands out: De Niro and Hoffman, though irreproachable, have too limited roles to be memorable, Pitt is too bland, and Jason Patrick isn't convincing at all.

    Sleepers is such a sleeper hit. It was released in '96, it was great, and everybody slept on it. I think I know why. It's a respectable sleeper mainly due to its personally private non-loud nature. The subject matter is saddening and stirring, and even outright sensitive, not very lively. While everyone you may talk to that's seen Sleepers loves and praises it, no one ever much talks about it. Just like Mystic River. Everyone you talk to that hasn't seen it, doesn't really know what it's about, just knows that Sleepers has a bunch of good actors in it. It coming out in 1996 also contributes. Sleepers plays in three distinct parts - the first introductory part showing the kids before the terrible incident is carefree and in a faster pace, the second story setting part taking place at the delinquent center is dismal, dragging and disturbing, and the third longest lasting part when the kids are adults is immersive, compelling, and the best part. The Sleepers' cast is great, Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman great, not even to mention Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver or Billy Crudup. Robert De Niro is at the top of his game and I'd be damned to critique him, there's nothing to critique. Hoffman's great as he nearly steals the whole show with his portrayal of drunken attorney Danny Snyder. Bacon is impressive in one of his most dominant roles. Brad Pitt really went for it with his character and he does a really good job. Jason Patric is strong and steady in his lead role. Minnie Driver is a sleeper actress as she is very well for Sleepers. Crudup is noticeably nice in his smaller role. The rest of the cast is completely rounded. Sleepers feels a little long but there's nothing close to being bad about it. While Sleepers may be somewhat slow, and put a few people to sleep, the collectiveness of the story is so agreeable it leaves a lasting impression on you.

    This is one of those movies that you don't forget. At least I didn't. When I sat down to re-watch it in 2013, I remembered how powerful it was when I saw it at the theater nearly 20 years earlier. You begin with a remarkable story, claimed by the author to be based on true events in his own life. Four childhood friends pull a prank that goes horribly wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent bystander. They are sent to reform school where there are repeatedly sexually and emotionally abused by several guards. We then fast-forward to when the boys are adults. One has become a lawyer, another has a low-level job at a newspaper, and the other two have become thugs. The thugs run into one of the guards at a bar and shoot him to death. Then the lawyer plots to get revenge against the other guards in the courtroom trial of the two thugs. And then you have a stellar cast. The child actors who portray the boys are flawless. Other key actors in key roles include Jason Patric (as one of the boys grown up), Minnie Driver as a friend of the boys since they were kids, Robert De Niro as the priest, Kevin Bacon as the main abusive guard, Jeffrey Donovan as another of the abusive guards, Terry Kinney as another of the abusive guards, Vittorio Gassman as a sort of godfather-like figure, and Dustin Hoffman as a broken down defense attorney. Ironically, the weakest performance in the film is by one of my favorite actors -- Brad Pitt. He's not at all convincing as a prosecuting attorney. And was he trying to talk like Marlon Brando??? And this was in the midst of what I consider to be Brad's finest period of acting. I can't explain it...but for me, his performance here just doesn't work. But we can still savor his other films from this time period, several of which are brilliant. Again, this is a powerful film with an absorbing story and generally fine acting. You'll note at the end that the "real" story is assessed from the point of view of the author and the authorities. Very interesting.

    When I first watched Barry Levinson's Sleepers, it traumatized me, as the horror of these young boys felt very real. The performances in this film are marvellous: Robert De Niro plays a likable, youthful priest who encourages a little misfit in the boys he looks over, but also tries to mould them into men who are prepared for the realities of life; Kevin Bacon knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of the sadistic, sick guard who watches the boys when they are sentenced to the boys detention centre in upstate New York, and even though it is tough to watch his character is played to perfection; when the boys grow up, we get some good turns from Jason Patric, Ron Eldard, Billy Crudup, and Brad Pitt, as scarred older men who all want some sort of justice for the abuse they suffered at the hands of guards when they were locked up. The story is great. We get a look into the lives of these boys before their incarceration, and then we see the repercussions of what happened to them while they were in the boys detention centre, which echo heavily through all their new lives. I felt much of the dialogue was very natural, and it never seemed to stray out of its world to make any grand statements; the script simply lets the story tell itself, and doesn't try to become an allegory for anything larger, which is totally fine because this plays as a dissection of how when a system fails to do what it is intended to do, those who have been damaged by that system end up either trying to tear it down, or using it against itself. It just lets the story happen, and this is how we come to understand its aim without any metaphors or parallels to anything else; sometimes simple works best. All in all I give this a 10 out of 10 stars because Sleepers is absolutely solid through and through. If only it could have been longer to get more of all the characters in, but there Levinson tells the story he wanted to, and I enjoy it every time I watch it over again.

    By this point, Sleepers is legendary, not only as a film that told of the shocking true story of abuse inside of juvenile prisons, but for launching the careers of some of today's best known stars. Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close.

    What a movie, I don't even know where to start. This movie is so touching and intriguing I could watch it every day and it would never get old. The movie has a great display of what it was like to live in hell's kitchen as a child. Then it shows horrible abuse and torture. The sad truth is that stuff happens all over the country in reform schools and not in them. It was a very tough place for the boys to live. Even thought they did commit a serious crime that punishment was not deserved at all. Then the great climax of the bar scene, which is one of my favorite scenes in all of movies. Then a courtroom drama that will want to make you cry making one of the boy's torturers admit the horrible truth. Then the touching scene which I won't go in to too much detail but the testimony of father Robert Carrillo. The whole movie is unbelievable and everybody played there roles great. Kevin Bacon was very convincing of the pedophile reform school guard. Robert De Niro played a big role and played it well. Although Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, and Jason Patric didn't play in the movie long it was long enough to show the great acting they all can perform. This movie was an excellent drama and more than worth giving it a try. With this all star cast, great plot, and great acting I am shocked this does not get more credit. Sleepers is truly a great film deserving a 10.

    This film is very well done, of course, being in the capable hands of Barry Levinson and a fantastic cast. I was pulled into it 100% until the trial. I find it not only hard to believe, but IMPOSSIBLE to believe, that any lawyer, under ANY circumstances, could ever have gotten the prison guard/witness/friend/co-worker of the murder victim to admit to the abuses that he committed (along with the murder victim) while a guard at the reform school. In my opinion, anyone as callous and cold-hearted as he was, as a multi-repeater rapist and torturer of children, wouldn't have even a shred of humanity left wherein he could be made to feel guilty in a court room. So that's where this movie fell apart for me.

    But, how can I rate a fictional story that is trying to pass itself off as a "true story" when everyone knows Hollywood wouldn't be faithful to a story if they swore on their mother's grave to do so! I have to give this more words than it deserves in order for it to qualify for a review. Why? Because I despise a story that is passed off as truth, when I've been around long enough to know that NOBODY in the movie industry cares one whit for the "truth." This industry is about money and power and that's it. I've seen too many times (AS IN EVERY TIME), when there really is a true story, and the author INSISTS that the movie stick to it faithfully, THEY NEVER DO! (Do your homework. It's a fact.) Let's do what the author and the screenwriter DID NOT do, and admit the motive for the book and the screenplay and the movie was first, MONEY! and secondly LOTS OF MONEY! Of course, after that, everyone wants a name for himself so he'll get paid better the next time around. Face reality. In Hollywood, the only time "truth" is really involved is when it's being hidden.

    I rate Sleepers with The Shawshank Redemption and October Sky as the best movies I have ever seen. The story is compelling and the characters and actors portraying them feel real. The direction is flawless but paced to ensure we the audience feel the various emotions depicted throughout the film. It is one of those rare movies you will enjoy more when you see it a second time. A special mention for Vittorio Gassman who plays the role of King Benny, one of the finest acting performances in the film which says a lot when you look at the cast. I do not think this movie received a single Oscar nomination. Maybe the content was considered too disturbing? Sleepers is a masterpiece and deserves a 10/10 rating.

When I sat down to re-watch it in 2013, I remembered how powerful it was when I saw it at the theater nearly 20 years earlier. You begin with a remarkable story, claimed by the author to be based on true events in his own life. Four childhood friends pull a prank that goes horribly wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent bystander. They are sent to reform school where there are repeatedly sexually and emotionally abused by several guards. We then fast-forward to when the boys are adults. One has become a lawyer, another has a low-level job at a newspaper, and the other two have become thugs. The thugs run into one of the guards at a bar and shoot him to death. Then the lawyer plots to get revenge against the other guards in the courtroom trial of the two thugs. And then you have a stellar cast. The child actors who portray the boys are flawless. Other key actors in key roles include Jason Patric (as one of the boys grown up), Minnie Driver as a friend of the boys since they were kids, Robert De Niro as the priest, Kevin Bacon as the main abusive guard, Jeffrey Donovan as another of the abusive guards, Terry Kinney as another of the abusive guards, Vittorio Gassman as a sort of godfather-like figure, and Dustin Hoffman as a broken down defense attorney. Ironically, the weakest performance in the film is by one of my favorite actors -- Brad Pitt. He's not at all convincing as a prosecuting attorney. And was he trying to talk like Marlon Brando??? And this was in the midst of what I consider to be Brad's finest period of acting. I can't explain it...but for me, his performance here just doesn't work. But we can still savor his other films from this time period, several of which are brilliant. Again, this is a powerful film with an absorbing story and generally fine acting. You'll note at the end that the "real" story is assessed from the point of view of the author and the authorities. Very interesting.

    When I first watched Barry Levinson's Sleepers, it traumatized me, as the horror of these young boys felt very real. The performances in this film are marvellous: Robert De Niro plays a likable, youthful priest who encourages a little misfit in the boys he looks over, but also tries to mould them into men who are prepared for the realities of life; Kevin Bacon knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of the sadistic, sick guard who watches the boys when they are sentenced to the boys detention centre in upstate New York, and even though it is tough to watch his character is played to perfection; when the boys grow up, we get some good turns from Jason Patric, Ron Eldard, Billy Crudup, and Brad Pitt, as scarred older men who all want some sort of justice for the abuse they suffered at the hands of guards when they were locked up. The story is great. We get a look into the lives of these boys before their incarceration, and then we see the repercussions of what happened to them while they were in the boys detention centre, which echo heavily through all their new lives. I felt much of the dialogue was very natural, and it never seemed to stray out of its world to make any grand statements; the script simply lets the story tell itself, and doesn't try to become an allegory for anything larger, which is totally fine because this plays as a dissection of how when a system fails to do what it is intended to do, those who have been damaged by that system end up either trying to tear it down, or using it against itself. It just lets the story happen, and this is how we come to understand its aim without any metaphors or parallels to anything else; sometimes simple works best. All in all I give this a 10 out of 10 stars because Sleepers is absolutely solid through and through. If only it could have been longer to get more of all the characters in, but there Levinson tells the story he wanted to, and I enjoy it every time I watch it over again.

    By this point, Sleepers is legendary, not only as a film that told of the shocking true story of abuse inside of juvenile prisons, but for launching the careers of some of today's best known stars. Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close.

    What a movie, I don't even know where to start. This movie is so touching and intriguing I could watch it every day and it would never get old. The movie has a great display of what it was like to live in hell's kitchen as a child. Then it shows horrible abuse and torture. The sad truth is that stuff happens all over the country in reform schools and not in them. It was a very tough place for the boys to live. Even thought they did commit a serious crime that punishment was not deserved at all. Then the great climax of the bar scene, which is one of my favorite scenes in all of movies. Then a courtroom drama that will want to make you cry making one of the boy's torturers admit the horrible truth. Then the touching scene which I won't go in to too much detail but the testimony of father Robert Carrillo. The whole movie is unbelievable and everybody played there roles great. Kevin Bacon was very convincing of the pedophile reform school guard. Robert De Niro played a big role and played it well. Although Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, and Jason Patric didn't play in the movie long it was long enough to show the great acting they all can perform. This movie was an excellent drama and more than worth giving it a try. With this all star cast, great plot, and great acting I am shocked this does not get more credit. Sleepers is truly a great film deserving a 10.

    This film is very well done, of course, being in the capable hands of Barry Levinson and a fantastic cast. I was pulled into it 100% until the trial. I find it not only hard to believe, but IMPOSSIBLE to believe, that any lawyer, under ANY circumstances, could ever have gotten the prison guard/witness/friend/co-worker of the murder victim to admit to the abuses that he committed (along with the murder victim) while a guard at the reform school. In my opinion, anyone as callous and cold-hearted as he was, as a multi-repeater rapist and torturer of children, wouldn't have even a shred of humanity left wherein he could be made to feel guilty in a court room. So that's where this movie fell apart for me.

    But, how can I rate a fictional story that is trying to pass itself off as a "true story" when everyone knows Hollywood wouldn't be faithful to a story if they swore on their mother's grave to do so! I have to give this more words than it deserves in order for it to qualify for a review. Why? Because I despise a story that is passed off as truth, when I've been around long enough to know that NOBODY in the movie industry cares one whit for the "truth." This industry is about money and power and that's it. I've seen too many times (AS IN EVERY TIME), when there really is a true story, and the author INSISTS that the movie stick to it faithfully, THEY NEVER DO! (Do your homework. It's a fact.) Let's do what the author and the screenwriter DID NOT do, and admit the motive for the book and the screenplay and the movie was first, MONEY! and secondly LOTS OF MONEY! Of course, after that, everyone wants a name for himself so he'll get paid better the next time around. Face reality. In Hollywood, the only time "truth" is really involved is when it's being hidden.

    I rate Sleepers with The Shawshank Redemption and October Sky as the best movies I have ever seen. The story is compelling and the characters and actors portraying them feel real. The direction is flawless but paced to ensure we the audience feel the various emotions depicted throughout the film. It is one of those rare movies you will enjoy more when you see it a second time. A special mention for Vittorio Gassman who plays the role of King Benny, one of the finest acting performances in the film which says a lot when you look at the cast. I do not think this movie received a single Oscar nomination. Maybe the content was considered too disturbing? Sleepers is a masterpiece and deserves a 10/10 rating.

    Adjectives such as compelling, suspenseful, mesmerizing, and haunting all apply with equal relevance to director Barry Levinson's serious-minded, tour de force tale of vengeance "Sleepers," starring Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patric, and Brad Pitt. The title comes from the street name for boys who have done time in juvenile lock-ups. Exploitative and depressing as the subject matter remains, "Sleepers" never stoops to vile instincts. Serving as his own scenarist, Levinson has woven an intricately designed yarn that unfurls like a Biblical epic. "Sleepers" charts the dire course of events when a winsome quartet of boys leaves the innocence of adolescence behind and plunges headlong into the fully blown evils of adulthood. Mind you, nothing lurid occurs on-screen. Compared with the Burt Reynolds & Jon Voight wilderness thriller "Deliverance," "Sleepers" seems almost tame in its depiction of evil. What takes place off-screen in this polished, downbeat film is what may disturb you. Adapted from Lorenzo Carcanterra's bestseller, "Sleepers' opens with a quaint bit of nostalgia. Audiences meet Lorenzo (Joe Perrino), Michael (Brad Renfro), John (Geoff Wigdor) and Tommy (Jonathan Tucker) and observe their lives in the tightly-knit sanctuary of New York City's Hell's Kitchen. Unspeakable horror derails the nostalgia and shatters their lives forever. Initially, Levinson appears to imitate Martin Scorsese. The film spans the late 1960s up the early 1970s as we follow the mischievous deeds of the four boys roaming those urban mean streets. Father Bobby (Robert De Niro of "Taxi Driver") is the sympathetic Catholic priest who befriends the boys and becomes their live-long confidant. One hot summer day, these reckless teens dream up a prank that nearly kills an innocent bystander. The court sentences them to a year in the Wilkinson Home of Boys reformatory. Before they've been locked up an hour, our protagonists realize the tragic mistake that they have made. They are beyond the protective confines of Hell's Kitchen and have fallen into a different kind of Hell. Sadistic guards led by smiling Sean Noyes (Kevin Bacon of "Footloose") prey on these defenseless minors. They rape and sodomize them on a regular basis in the dark cellars beneath the reformatory. Two of the four emerge the worse for their experiences. John Reilly (Ron Eldard of "Drop Dead Fred") and Tommy Marcano (Billy Crudup of "Watchmen") turn into armed and deadly street hoodlums who deal narcotics and act as assassins. Lorenzo (Jason Patric) and Michael (Brad Pitt) take the high road. One winds up at a newspaper while the other lands a post in the district attorney's office. The years elapse. One night John and Tommy spot Noyes in a neighborhood restaurant. After they refresh Noyes' memory, they gun him down in cold blood. When they are arrested for murder, childhood pal Michael volunteers to prosecute them. Witnesses can place them at the scene of the homicide, but the attorney decides to tip the scales of justice. Lorenzo and he contrive an elaborate scheme not only to win freedom for their friends but also pay back the despicable guard. Some critics have complained that Kevin Bacon's demise half-way through the story qualifies as anti-climactic. Nonsense! "Sleepers" concerns friendship and how these friends with an entire community conspire to save John and Tommy. "Sleepers" invokes the vigilante justice formula of the recent John Grisham movie "A Time to Kill" in condoning the clear-cut murder of a repugnant individual. Director Barry Levinson has helmed several impressive films, but none compare with the hard-edged, clinical fatalism of this epic. "Sleepers" amounts to a stroll on the seamy side for the director of movies such as "Tin Men," "Rain Man," "Diner," "The Natural," "Bugsy," and "Disclosure." Meanwhile, "Sleepers' wallows in the ironic half-light of an amoral universe. Nevertheless, "Sleepers" is pure Levinson, from its 1960s era setting to the camaraderie of its leads. Levinson has fashioned a literate screenplay. During the first hour, he sets up his characters and explores the insular community of Hell's Kitchen. Everything here foreshadows the events which follows Noyes' murder. Levinson's tragedy is not so much about exorcising demons from their past as it is about heading off another catastrophe. Wisely, Levinson tones down the charisma that distinguishes his stellar cast of heartthrobs. As the shrewd assistant district attorney who orchestrates the cover-up in court, Pitt appears commendably taciturn though frayed in his shady effort to win justice for his childhood friends. Jason Patric is just guarded in his attitude but just as vindictive. Michael and Lorenzo both live out a vengeful fantasy as much a part of their Hell's Kitchen heritage as it is the Alexander Dumas novel "The Count of Monte Cristo" that he learned to savor at Wilkinson. Kevin Bacon endows his abusive prison guard with a cheerful decadence. You'll despise Bacon's depraved sentinel who is determined to teach his juvenile charges about rules and discipline. As Noyes' closet-cohort Ferguson, Terry Kinny has a devastating scene in court when he confesses his part in molesting these young men. Despite his short-time on screen, Dustin Hoffman dominates the action as an alcoholic, skid-row attorney who doubts his ability to acquit his guilty-as-sin clients. As stunning as "Sleepers" is, you may shy away from the experiencing its gritty realism more than once. Whether you skulk out of the movie feeling like a grimy, morally-bankrupt conspirator or trudge away from it with a world full of cynicism, you may have a difficult time either shrugging off or dismissing this evocative film.

    Sleepers is divided into two quite heterogeneous parts, where events are related in a rather heavy way by a continuous voice over, and through a direction that lacks a bit of ambition and that is sometimes too schmaltzy (emphatic shots, sad soundtrack). The first part is dark and terrifying with this gut-wrenching and poignant story that unfortunately certainly must have occurred more than once. The second part however struggles a bit more and is often a bit lengthy, despite some excellent scenes, mainly the ones at the courthouse. Most importantly, the vengeance scheme and the trial seem very far-fetched and very little credible, therefore inducing strong doubts about their veracity. As for the cast, it isn't as impressive as one could have thought in the first place. Apart from the excellent Kevin Bacon, no one really stands out: De Niro and Hoffman, though irreproachable, have too limited roles to be memorable, Pitt is too bland, and Jason Patrick isn't convincing at all.

    Sleepers is such a sleeper hit. It was released in '96, it was great, and everybody slept on it. I think I know why. It's a respectable sleeper mainly due to its personally private non-loud nature. The subject matter is saddening and stirring, and even outright sensitive, not very lively. While everyone you may talk to that's seen Sleepers loves and praises it, no one ever much talks about it. Just like Mystic River. Everyone you talk to that hasn't seen it, doesn't really know what it's about, just knows that Sleepers has a bunch of good actors in it. It coming out in 1996 also contributes. Sleepers plays in three distinct parts - the first introductory part showing the kids before the terrible incident is carefree and in a faster pace, the second story setting part taking place at the delinquent center is dismal, dragging and disturbing, and the third longest lasting part when the kids are adults is immersive, compelling, and the best part. The Sleepers' cast is great, Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman great, not even to mention Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver or Billy Crudup. Robert De Niro is at the top of his game and I'd be damned to critique him, there's nothing to critique. Hoffman's great as he nearly steals the whole show with his portrayal of drunken attorney Danny Snyder. Bacon is impressive in one of his most dominant roles. Brad Pitt really went for it with his character and he does a really good job. Jason Patric is strong and steady in his lead role. Minnie Driver is a sleeper actress as she is very well for Sleepers. Crudup is noticeably nice in his smaller role. The rest of the cast is completely rounded. Sleepers feels a little long but there's nothing close to being bad about it. While Sleepers may be somewhat slow, and put a few people to sleep, the collectiveness of the story is so agreeable it leaves a lasting impression on you.

    Adjectives such as compelling, suspenseful, mesmerizing, and haunting all apply with equal relevance to director Barry Levinson's serious-minded, tour de force tale of vengeance "Sleepers," starring Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patric, and Brad Pitt. The title comes from the street name for boys who have done time in juvenile lock-ups. Exploitative and depressing as the subject matter remains, "Sleepers" never stoops to vile instincts. Serving as his own scenarist, Levinson has woven an intricately designed yarn that unfurls like a Biblical epic. "Sleepers" charts the dire course of events when a winsome quartet of boys leaves the innocence of adolescence behind and plunges headlong into the fully blown evils of adulthood. Mind you, nothing lurid occurs on-screen. Compared with the Burt Reynolds & Jon Voight wilderness thriller "Deliverance," "Sleepers" seems almost tame in its depiction of evil. What takes place off-screen in this polished, downbeat film is what may disturb you. Adapted from Lorenzo Carcanterra's bestseller, "Sleepers' opens with a quaint bit of nostalgia. Audiences meet Lorenzo (Joe Perrino), Michael (Brad Renfro), John (Geoff Wigdor) and Tommy (Jonathan Tucker) and observe their lives in the tightly-knit sanctuary of New York City's Hell's Kitchen. Unspeakable horror derails the nostalgia and shatters their lives forever. Initially, Levinson appears to imitate Martin Scorsese. The film spans the late 1960s up the early 1970s as we follow the mischievous deeds of the four boys roaming those urban mean streets. Father Bobby (Robert De Niro of "Taxi Driver") is the sympathetic Catholic priest who befriends the boys and becomes their live-long confidant. One hot summer day, these reckless teens dream up a prank that nearly kills an innocent bystander. The court sentences them to a year in the Wilkinson Home of Boys reformatory. Before they've been locked up an hour, our protagonists realize the tragic mistake that they have made. They are beyond the protective confines of Hell's Kitchen and have fallen into a different kind of Hell. Sadistic guards led by smiling Sean Noyes (Kevin Bacon of "Footloose") prey on these defenseless minors. They rape and sodomize them on a regular basis in the dark cellars beneath the reformatory. Two of the four emerge the worse for their experiences. John Reilly (Ron Eldard of "Drop Dead Fred") and Tommy Marcano (Billy Crudup of "Watchmen") turn into armed and deadly street hoodlums who deal narcotics and act as assassins. Lorenzo (Jason Patric) and Michael (Brad Pitt) take the high road. One winds up at a newspaper while the other lands a post in the district attorney's office. The years elapse. One night John and Tommy spot Noyes in a neighborhood restaurant. After they refresh Noyes' memory, they gun him down in cold blood. When they are arrested for murder, childhood pal Michael volunteers to prosecute them. Witnesses can place them at the scene of the homicide, but the attorney decides to tip the scales of justice. Lorenzo and he contrive an elaborate scheme not only to win freedom for their friends but also pay back the despicable guard. Some critics have complained that Kevin Bacon's demise half-way through the story qualifies as anti-climactic. Nonsense! "Sleepers" concerns friendship and how these friends with an entire community conspire to save John and Tommy. "Sleepers" invokes the vigilante justice formula of the recent John Grisham movie "A Time to Kill" in condoning the clear-cut murder of a repugnant individual. Director Barry Levinson has helmed several impressive films, but none compare with the hard-edged, clinical fatalism of this epic. "Sleepers" amounts to a stroll on the seamy side for the director of movies such as "Tin Men," "Rain Man," "Diner," "The Natural," "Bugsy," and "Disclosure." Meanwhile, "Sleepers' wallows in the ironic half-light of an amoral universe. Nevertheless, "Sleepers" is pure Levinson, from its 1960s era setting to the camaraderie of its leads. Levinson has fashioned a literate screenplay. During the first hour, he sets up his characters and explores the insular community of Hell's Kitchen. Everything here foreshadows the events which follows Noyes' murder. Levinson's tragedy is not so much about exorcising demons from their past as it is about heading off another catastrophe. Wisely, Levinson tones down the charisma that distinguishes his stellar cast of heartthrobs. As the shrewd assistant district attorney who orchestrates the cover-up in court, Pitt appears commendably taciturn though frayed in his shady effort to win justice for his childhood friends. Jason Patric is just guarded in his attitude but just as vindictive. Michael and Lorenzo both live out a vengeful fantasy as much a part of their Hell's Kitchen heritage as it is the Alexander Dumas novel "The Count of Monte Cristo" that he learned to savor at Wilkinson. Kevin Bacon endows his abusive prison guard with a cheerful decadence. You'll despise Bacon's depraved sentinel who is determined to teach his juvenile charges about rules and discipline. As Noyes' closet-cohort Ferguson, Terry Kinny has a devastating scene in court when he confesses his part in molesting these young men. Despite his short-time on screen, Dustin Hoffman dominates the action as an alcoholic, skid-row attorney who doubts his ability to acquit his guilty-as-sin clients. As stunning as "Sleepers" is, you may shy away from the experiencing its gritty realism more than once. Whether you skulk out of the movie feeling like a grimy, morally-bankrupt conspirator or trudge away from it with a world full of cynicism, you may have a difficult time either shrugging off or dismissing this evocative film.

    Sleepers is divided into two quite heterogeneous parts, where events are related in a rather heavy way by a continuous voice over, and through a direction that lacks a bit of ambition and that is sometimes too schmaltzy (emphatic shots, sad soundtrack). The first part is dark and terrifying with this gut-wrenching and poignant story that unfortunately certainly must have occurred more than once. The second part however struggles a bit more and is often a bit lengthy, despite some excellent scenes, mainly the ones at the courthouse. Most importantly, the vengeance scheme and the trial seem very far-fetched and very little credible, therefore inducing strong doubts about their veracity. As for the cast, it isn't as impressive as one could have thought in the first place. Apart from the excellent Kevin Bacon, no one really stands out: De Niro and Hoffman, though irreproachable, have too limited roles to be memorable, Pitt is too bland, and Jason Patrick isn't convincing at all.

    Sleepers is such a sleeper hit. It was released in '96, it was great, and everybody slept on it. I think I know why. It's a respectable sleeper mainly due to its personally private non-loud nature. The subject matter is saddening and stirring, and even outright sensitive, not very lively. While everyone you may talk to that's seen Sleepers loves and praises it, no one ever much talks about it. Just like Mystic River. Everyone you talk to that hasn't seen it, doesn't really know what it's about, just knows that Sleepers has a bunch of good actors in it. It coming out in 1996 also contributes. Sleepers plays in three distinct parts - the first introductory part showing the kids before the terrible incident is carefree and in a faster pace, the second story setting part taking place at the delinquent center is dismal, dragging and disturbing, and the third longest lasting part when the kids are adults is immersive, compelling, and the best part. The Sleepers' cast is great, Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman great, not even to mention Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver or Billy Crudup. Robert De Niro is at the top of his game and I'd be damned to critique him, there's nothing to critique. Hoffman's great as he nearly steals the whole show with his portrayal of drunken attorney Danny Snyder. Bacon is impressive in one of his most dominant roles. Brad Pitt really went for it with his character and he does a really good job. Jason Patric is strong and steady in his lead role. Minnie Driver is a sleeper actress as she is very well for Sleepers. Crudup is noticeably nice in his smaller role. The rest of the cast is completely rounded. Sleepers feels a little long but there's nothing close to being bad about it. While Sleepers may be somewhat slow, and put a few people to sleep, the collectiveness of the story is so agreeable it leaves a lasting impression on you.

    This is one of those movies that you don't forget. At least I didn't. When I sat down to re-watch it in 2013, I remembered how powerful it was when I saw it at the theater nearly 20 years earlier. You begin with a remarkable story, claimed by the author to be based on true events in his own life. Four childhood friends pull a prank that goes horribly wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent bystander. They are sent to reform school where there are repeatedly sexually and emotionally abused by several guards. We then fast-forward to when the boys are adults. One has become a lawyer, another has a low-level job at a newspaper, and the other two have become thugs. The thugs run into one of the guards at a bar and shoot him to death. Then the lawyer plots to get revenge against the other guards in the courtroom trial of the two thugs. And then you have a stellar cast. The child actors who portray the boys are flawless. Other key actors in key roles include Jason Patric (as one of the boys grown up), Minnie Driver as a friend of the boys since they were kids, Robert De Niro as the priest, Kevin Bacon as the main abusive guard, Jeffrey Donovan as another of the abusive guards, Terry Kinney as another of the abusive guards, Vittorio Gassman as a sort of godfather-like figure, and Dustin Hoffman as a broken down defense attorney. Ironically, the weakest performance in the film is by one of my favorite actors -- Brad Pitt. He's not at all convincing as a prosecuting attorney. And was he trying to talk like Marlon Brando??? And this was in the midst of what I consider to be Brad's finest period of acting. I can't explain it...but for me, his performance here just doesn't work. But we can still savor his other films from this time period, several of which are brilliant. Again, this is a powerful film with an absorbing story and generally fine acting. You'll note at the end that the "real" story is assessed from the point of view of the author and the authorities. Very interesting.

    When I first watched Barry Levinson's Sleepers, it traumatized me, as the horror of these young boys felt very real. The performances in this film are marvellous: Robert De Niro plays a likable, youthful priest who encourages a little misfit in the boys he looks over, but also tries to mould them into men who are prepared for the realities of life; Kevin Bacon knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of the sadistic, sick guard who watches the boys when they are sentenced to the boys detention centre in upstate New York, and even though it is tough to watch his character is played to perfection; when the boys grow up, we get some good turns from Jason Patric, Ron Eldard, Billy Crudup, and Brad Pitt, as scarred older men who all want some sort of justice for the abuse they suffered at the hands of guards when they were locked up. The story is great. We get a look into the lives of these boys before their incarceration, and then we see the repercussions of what happened to them while they were in the boys detention centre, which echo heavily through all their new lives. I felt much of the dialogue was very natural, and it never seemed to stray out of its world to make any grand statements; the script simply lets the story tell itself, and doesn't try to become an allegory for anything larger, which is totally fine because this plays as a dissection of how when a system fails to do what it is intended to do, those who have been damaged by that system end up either trying to tear it down, or using it against itself. It just lets the story happen, and this is how we come to understand its aim without any metaphors or parallels to anything else; sometimes simple works best. All in all I give this a 10 out of 10 stars because Sleepers is absolutely solid through and through. If only it could have been longer to get more of all the characters in, but there Levinson tells the story he wanted to, and I enjoy it every time I watch it over again.

    By this point, Sleepers is legendary, not only as a film that told of the shocking true story of abuse inside of juvenile prisons, but for launching the careers of some of today's best known stars. Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close.

    What a movie, I don't even know where to start. This movie is so touching and intriguing I could watch it every day and it would never get old. The movie has a great display of what it was like to live in hell's kitchen as a child. Then it shows horrible abuse and torture. The sad truth is that stuff happens all over the country in reform schools and not in them. It was a very tough place for the boys to live. Even thought they did commit a serious crime that punishment was not deserved at all. Then the great climax of the bar scene, which is one of my favorite scenes in all of movies. Then a courtroom drama that will want to make you cry making one of the boy's torturers admit the horrible truth. Then the touching scene which I won't go in to too much detail but the testimony of father Robert Carrillo. The whole movie is unbelievable and everybody played there roles great. Kevin Bacon was very convincing of the pedophile reform school guard. Robert De Niro played a big role and played it well. Although Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, and Jason Patric didn't play in the movie long it was long enough to show the great acting they all can perform. This movie was an excellent drama and more than worth giving it a try. With this all star cast, great plot, and great acting I am shocked this does not get more credit. Sleepers is truly a great film deserving a 10.

    This film is very well done, of course, being in the capable hands of Barry Levinson and a fantastic cast. I was pulled into it 100% until the trial. I find it not only hard to believe, but IMPOSSIBLE to believe, that any lawyer, under ANY circumstances, could ever have gotten the prison guard/witness/friend/co-worker of the murder victim to admit to the abuses that he committed (along with the murder victim) while a guard at the reform school. In my opinion, anyone as callous and cold-hearted as he was, as a multi-repeater rapist and torturer of children, wouldn't have even a shred of humanity left wherein he could be made to feel guilty in a court room. So that's where this movie fell apart for me.

    But, how can I rate a fictional story that is trying to pass itself off as a "true story" when everyone knows Hollywood wouldn't be faithful to a story if they swore on their mother's grave to do so! I have to give this more words than it deserves in order for it to qualify for a review. Why? Because I despise a story that is passed off as truth, when I've been around long enough to know that NOBODY in the movie industry cares one whit for the "truth." This industry is about money and power and that's it. I've seen too many times (AS IN EVERY TIME), when there really is a true story, and the author INSISTS that the movie stick to it faithfully, THEY NEVER DO! (Do your homework. It's a fact.) Let's do what the author and the screenwriter DID NOT do, and admit the motive for the book and the screenplay and the movie was first, MONEY! and secondly LOTS OF MONEY! Of course, after that, everyone wants a name for himself so he'll get paid better the next time around. Face reality. In Hollywood, the only time "truth" is really involved is when it's being hidden.

    I rate Sleepers with The Shawshank Redemption and October Sky as the best movies I have ever seen. The story is compelling and the characters and actors portraying them feel real. The direction is flawless but paced to ensure we the audience feel the various emotions depicted throughout the film. It is one of those rare movies you will enjoy more when you see it a second time. A special mention for Vittorio Gassman who plays the role of King Benny, one of the finest acting performances in the film which says a lot when you look at the cast. I do not think this movie received a single Oscar nomination. Maybe the content was considered too disturbing? Sleepers is a masterpiece and deserves a 10/10 rating.

The performances in this film are marvellous: Robert De Niro plays a likable, youthful priest who encourages a little misfit in the boys he looks over, but also tries to mould them into men who are prepared for the realities of life; Kevin Bacon knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of the sadistic, sick guard who watches the boys when they are sentenced to the boys detention centre in upstate New York, and even though it is tough to watch his character is played to perfection; when the boys grow up, we get some good turns from Jason Patric, Ron Eldard, Billy Crudup, and Brad Pitt, as scarred older men who all want some sort of justice for the abuse they suffered at the hands of guards when they were locked up. The story is great. We get a look into the lives of these boys before their incarceration, and then we see the repercussions of what happened to them while they were in the boys detention centre, which echo heavily through all their new lives. I felt much of the dialogue was very natural, and it never seemed to stray out of its world to make any grand statements; the script simply lets the story tell itself, and doesn't try to become an allegory for anything larger, which is totally fine because this plays as a dissection of how when a system fails to do what it is intended to do, those who have been damaged by that system end up either trying to tear it down, or using it against itself. It just lets the story happen, and this is how we come to understand its aim without any metaphors or parallels to anything else; sometimes simple works best. All in all I give this a 10 out of 10 stars because Sleepers is absolutely solid through and through. If only it could have been longer to get more of all the characters in, but there Levinson tells the story he wanted to, and I enjoy it every time I watch it over again.

    By this point, Sleepers is legendary, not only as a film that told of the shocking true story of abuse inside of juvenile prisons, but for launching the careers of some of today's best known stars. Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close.

    What a movie, I don't even know where to start. This movie is so touching and intriguing I could watch it every day and it would never get old. The movie has a great display of what it was like to live in hell's kitchen as a child. Then it shows horrible abuse and torture. The sad truth is that stuff happens all over the country in reform schools and not in them. It was a very tough place for the boys to live. Even thought they did commit a serious crime that punishment was not deserved at all. Then the great climax of the bar scene, which is one of my favorite scenes in all of movies. Then a courtroom drama that will want to make you cry making one of the boy's torturers admit the horrible truth. Then the touching scene which I won't go in to too much detail but the testimony of father Robert Carrillo. The whole movie is unbelievable and everybody played there roles great. Kevin Bacon was very convincing of the pedophile reform school guard. Robert De Niro played a big role and played it well. Although Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, and Jason Patric didn't play in the movie long it was long enough to show the great acting they all can perform. This movie was an excellent drama and more than worth giving it a try. With this all star cast, great plot, and great acting I am shocked this does not get more credit. Sleepers is truly a great film deserving a 10.

    This film is very well done, of course, being in the capable hands of Barry Levinson and a fantastic cast. I was pulled into it 100% until the trial. I find it not only hard to believe, but IMPOSSIBLE to believe, that any lawyer, under ANY circumstances, could ever have gotten the prison guard/witness/friend/co-worker of the murder victim to admit to the abuses that he committed (along with the murder victim) while a guard at the reform school. In my opinion, anyone as callous and cold-hearted as he was, as a multi-repeater rapist and torturer of children, wouldn't have even a shred of humanity left wherein he could be made to feel guilty in a court room. So that's where this movie fell apart for me.

    But, how can I rate a fictional story that is trying to pass itself off as a "true story" when everyone knows Hollywood wouldn't be faithful to a story if they swore on their mother's grave to do so! I have to give this more words than it deserves in order for it to qualify for a review. Why? Because I despise a story that is passed off as truth, when I've been around long enough to know that NOBODY in the movie industry cares one whit for the "truth." This industry is about money and power and that's it. I've seen too many times (AS IN EVERY TIME), when there really is a true story, and the author INSISTS that the movie stick to it faithfully, THEY NEVER DO! (Do your homework. It's a fact.) Let's do what the author and the screenwriter DID NOT do, and admit the motive for the book and the screenplay and the movie was first, MONEY! and secondly LOTS OF MONEY! Of course, after that, everyone wants a name for himself so he'll get paid better the next time around. Face reality. In Hollywood, the only time "truth" is really involved is when it's being hidden.

    I rate Sleepers with The Shawshank Redemption and October Sky as the best movies I have ever seen. The story is compelling and the characters and actors portraying them feel real. The direction is flawless but paced to ensure we the audience feel the various emotions depicted throughout the film. It is one of those rare movies you will enjoy more when you see it a second time. A special mention for Vittorio Gassman who plays the role of King Benny, one of the finest acting performances in the film which says a lot when you look at the cast. I do not think this movie received a single Oscar nomination. Maybe the content was considered too disturbing? Sleepers is a masterpiece and deserves a 10/10 rating.

    Adjectives such as compelling, suspenseful, mesmerizing, and haunting all apply with equal relevance to director Barry Levinson's serious-minded, tour de force tale of vengeance "Sleepers," starring Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patric, and Brad Pitt. The title comes from the street name for boys who have done time in juvenile lock-ups. Exploitative and depressing as the subject matter remains, "Sleepers" never stoops to vile instincts. Serving as his own scenarist, Levinson has woven an intricately designed yarn that unfurls like a Biblical epic. "Sleepers" charts the dire course of events when a winsome quartet of boys leaves the innocence of adolescence behind and plunges headlong into the fully blown evils of adulthood. Mind you, nothing lurid occurs on-screen. Compared with the Burt Reynolds & Jon Voight wilderness thriller "Deliverance," "Sleepers" seems almost tame in its depiction of evil. What takes place off-screen in this polished, downbeat film is what may disturb you. Adapted from Lorenzo Carcanterra's bestseller, "Sleepers' opens with a quaint bit of nostalgia. Audiences meet Lorenzo (Joe Perrino), Michael (Brad Renfro), John (Geoff Wigdor) and Tommy (Jonathan Tucker) and observe their lives in the tightly-knit sanctuary of New York City's Hell's Kitchen. Unspeakable horror derails the nostalgia and shatters their lives forever. Initially, Levinson appears to imitate Martin Scorsese. The film spans the late 1960s up the early 1970s as we follow the mischievous deeds of the four boys roaming those urban mean streets. Father Bobby (Robert De Niro of "Taxi Driver") is the sympathetic Catholic priest who befriends the boys and becomes their live-long confidant. One hot summer day, these reckless teens dream up a prank that nearly kills an innocent bystander. The court sentences them to a year in the Wilkinson Home of Boys reformatory. Before they've been locked up an hour, our protagonists realize the tragic mistake that they have made. They are beyond the protective confines of Hell's Kitchen and have fallen into a different kind of Hell. Sadistic guards led by smiling Sean Noyes (Kevin Bacon of "Footloose") prey on these defenseless minors. They rape and sodomize them on a regular basis in the dark cellars beneath the reformatory. Two of the four emerge the worse for their experiences. John Reilly (Ron Eldard of "Drop Dead Fred") and Tommy Marcano (Billy Crudup of "Watchmen") turn into armed and deadly street hoodlums who deal narcotics and act as assassins. Lorenzo (Jason Patric) and Michael (Brad Pitt) take the high road. One winds up at a newspaper while the other lands a post in the district attorney's office. The years elapse. One night John and Tommy spot Noyes in a neighborhood restaurant. After they refresh Noyes' memory, they gun him down in cold blood. When they are arrested for murder, childhood pal Michael volunteers to prosecute them. Witnesses can place them at the scene of the homicide, but the attorney decides to tip the scales of justice. Lorenzo and he contrive an elaborate scheme not only to win freedom for their friends but also pay back the despicable guard. Some critics have complained that Kevin Bacon's demise half-way through the story qualifies as anti-climactic. Nonsense! "Sleepers" concerns friendship and how these friends with an entire community conspire to save John and Tommy. "Sleepers" invokes the vigilante justice formula of the recent John Grisham movie "A Time to Kill" in condoning the clear-cut murder of a repugnant individual. Director Barry Levinson has helmed several impressive films, but none compare with the hard-edged, clinical fatalism of this epic. "Sleepers" amounts to a stroll on the seamy side for the director of movies such as "Tin Men," "Rain Man," "Diner," "The Natural," "Bugsy," and "Disclosure." Meanwhile, "Sleepers' wallows in the ironic half-light of an amoral universe. Nevertheless, "Sleepers" is pure Levinson, from its 1960s era setting to the camaraderie of its leads. Levinson has fashioned a literate screenplay. During the first hour, he sets up his characters and explores the insular community of Hell's Kitchen. Everything here foreshadows the events which follows Noyes' murder. Levinson's tragedy is not so much about exorcising demons from their past as it is about heading off another catastrophe. Wisely, Levinson tones down the charisma that distinguishes his stellar cast of heartthrobs. As the shrewd assistant district attorney who orchestrates the cover-up in court, Pitt appears commendably taciturn though frayed in his shady effort to win justice for his childhood friends. Jason Patric is just guarded in his attitude but just as vindictive. Michael and Lorenzo both live out a vengeful fantasy as much a part of their Hell's Kitchen heritage as it is the Alexander Dumas novel "The Count of Monte Cristo" that he learned to savor at Wilkinson. Kevin Bacon endows his abusive prison guard with a cheerful decadence. You'll despise Bacon's depraved sentinel who is determined to teach his juvenile charges about rules and discipline. As Noyes' closet-cohort Ferguson, Terry Kinny has a devastating scene in court when he confesses his part in molesting these young men. Despite his short-time on screen, Dustin Hoffman dominates the action as an alcoholic, skid-row attorney who doubts his ability to acquit his guilty-as-sin clients. As stunning as "Sleepers" is, you may shy away from the experiencing its gritty realism more than once. Whether you skulk out of the movie feeling like a grimy, morally-bankrupt conspirator or trudge away from it with a world full of cynicism, you may have a difficult time either shrugging off or dismissing this evocative film.

    Sleepers is divided into two quite heterogeneous parts, where events are related in a rather heavy way by a continuous voice over, and through a direction that lacks a bit of ambition and that is sometimes too schmaltzy (emphatic shots, sad soundtrack). The first part is dark and terrifying with this gut-wrenching and poignant story that unfortunately certainly must have occurred more than once. The second part however struggles a bit more and is often a bit lengthy, despite some excellent scenes, mainly the ones at the courthouse. Most importantly, the vengeance scheme and the trial seem very far-fetched and very little credible, therefore inducing strong doubts about their veracity. As for the cast, it isn't as impressive as one could have thought in the first place. Apart from the excellent Kevin Bacon, no one really stands out: De Niro and Hoffman, though irreproachable, have too limited roles to be memorable, Pitt is too bland, and Jason Patrick isn't convincing at all.

    Sleepers is such a sleeper hit. It was released in '96, it was great, and everybody slept on it. I think I know why. It's a respectable sleeper mainly due to its personally private non-loud nature. The subject matter is saddening and stirring, and even outright sensitive, not very lively. While everyone you may talk to that's seen Sleepers loves and praises it, no one ever much talks about it. Just like Mystic River. Everyone you talk to that hasn't seen it, doesn't really know what it's about, just knows that Sleepers has a bunch of good actors in it. It coming out in 1996 also contributes. Sleepers plays in three distinct parts - the first introductory part showing the kids before the terrible incident is carefree and in a faster pace, the second story setting part taking place at the delinquent center is dismal, dragging and disturbing, and the third longest lasting part when the kids are adults is immersive, compelling, and the best part. The Sleepers' cast is great, Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman great, not even to mention Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver or Billy Crudup. Robert De Niro is at the top of his game and I'd be damned to critique him, there's nothing to critique. Hoffman's great as he nearly steals the whole show with his portrayal of drunken attorney Danny Snyder. Bacon is impressive in one of his most dominant roles. Brad Pitt really went for it with his character and he does a really good job. Jason Patric is strong and steady in his lead role. Minnie Driver is a sleeper actress as she is very well for Sleepers. Crudup is noticeably nice in his smaller role. The rest of the cast is completely rounded. Sleepers feels a little long but there's nothing close to being bad about it. While Sleepers may be somewhat slow, and put a few people to sleep, the collectiveness of the story is so agreeable it leaves a lasting impression on you.

    This is one of those movies that you don't forget. At least I didn't. When I sat down to re-watch it in 2013, I remembered how powerful it was when I saw it at the theater nearly 20 years earlier. You begin with a remarkable story, claimed by the author to be based on true events in his own life. Four childhood friends pull a prank that goes horribly wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent bystander. They are sent to reform school where there are repeatedly sexually and emotionally abused by several guards. We then fast-forward to when the boys are adults. One has become a lawyer, another has a low-level job at a newspaper, and the other two have become thugs. The thugs run into one of the guards at a bar and shoot him to death. Then the lawyer plots to get revenge against the other guards in the courtroom trial of the two thugs. And then you have a stellar cast. The child actors who portray the boys are flawless. Other key actors in key roles include Jason Patric (as one of the boys grown up), Minnie Driver as a friend of the boys since they were kids, Robert De Niro as the priest, Kevin Bacon as the main abusive guard, Jeffrey Donovan as another of the abusive guards, Terry Kinney as another of the abusive guards, Vittorio Gassman as a sort of godfather-like figure, and Dustin Hoffman as a broken down defense attorney. Ironically, the weakest performance in the film is by one of my favorite actors -- Brad Pitt. He's not at all convincing as a prosecuting attorney. And was he trying to talk like Marlon Brando??? And this was in the midst of what I consider to be Brad's finest period of acting. I can't explain it...but for me, his performance here just doesn't work. But we can still savor his other films from this time period, several of which are brilliant. Again, this is a powerful film with an absorbing story and generally fine acting. You'll note at the end that the "real" story is assessed from the point of view of the author and the authorities. Very interesting.

Lorenzo (Jason Patric) and Michael (Brad Pitt) take the high road. One winds up at a newspaper while the other lands a post in the district attorney's office. The years elapse. One night John and Tommy spot Noyes in a neighborhood restaurant. After they refresh Noyes' memory, they gun him down in cold blood. When they are arrested for murder, childhood pal Michael volunteers to prosecute them. Witnesses can place them at the scene of the homicide, but the attorney decides to tip the scales of justice. Lorenzo and he contrive an elaborate scheme not only to win freedom for their friends but also pay back the despicable guard. Some critics have complained that Kevin Bacon's demise half-way through the story qualifies as anti-climactic. Nonsense! "Sleepers" concerns friendship and how these friends with an entire community conspire to save John and Tommy. "Sleepers" invokes the vigilante justice formula of the recent John Grisham movie "A Time to Kill" in condoning the clear-cut murder of a repugnant individual. Director Barry Levinson has helmed several impressive films, but none compare with the hard-edged, clinical fatalism of this epic. "Sleepers" amounts to a stroll on the seamy side for the director of movies such as "Tin Men," "Rain Man," "Diner," "The Natural," "Bugsy," and "Disclosure." Meanwhile, "Sleepers' wallows in the ironic half-light of an amoral universe. Nevertheless, "Sleepers" is pure Levinson, from its 1960s era setting to the camaraderie of its leads. Levinson has fashioned a literate screenplay. During the first hour, he sets up his characters and explores the insular community of Hell's Kitchen. Everything here foreshadows the events which follows Noyes' murder. Levinson's tragedy is not so much about exorcising demons from their past as it is about heading off another catastrophe. Wisely, Levinson tones down the charisma that distinguishes his stellar cast of heartthrobs. As the shrewd assistant district attorney who orchestrates the cover-up in court, Pitt appears commendably taciturn though frayed in his shady effort to win justice for his childhood friends. Jason Patric is just guarded in his attitude but just as vindictive. Michael and Lorenzo both live out a vengeful fantasy as much a part of their Hell's Kitchen heritage as it is the Alexander Dumas novel "The Count of Monte Cristo" that he learned to savor at Wilkinson. Kevin Bacon endows his abusive prison guard with a cheerful decadence. You'll despise Bacon's depraved sentinel who is determined to teach his juvenile charges about rules and discipline. As Noyes' closet-cohort Ferguson, Terry Kinny has a devastating scene in court when he confesses his part in molesting these young men. Despite his short-time on screen, Dustin Hoffman dominates the action as an alcoholic, skid-row attorney who doubts his ability to acquit his guilty-as-sin clients. As stunning as "Sleepers" is, you may shy away from the experiencing its gritty realism more than once. Whether you skulk out of the movie feeling like a grimy, morally-bankrupt conspirator or trudge away from it with a world full of cynicism, you may have a difficult time either shrugging off or dismissing this evocative film.

    Sleepers is divided into two quite heterogeneous parts, where events are related in a rather heavy way by a continuous voice over, and through a direction that lacks a bit of ambition and that is sometimes too schmaltzy (emphatic shots, sad soundtrack). The first part is dark and terrifying with this gut-wrenching and poignant story that unfortunately certainly must have occurred more than once. The second part however struggles a bit more and is often a bit lengthy, despite some excellent scenes, mainly the ones at the courthouse. Most importantly, the vengeance scheme and the trial seem very far-fetched and very little credible, therefore inducing strong doubts about their veracity. As for the cast, it isn't as impressive as one could have thought in the first place. Apart from the excellent Kevin Bacon, no one really stands out: De Niro and Hoffman, though irreproachable, have too limited roles to be memorable, Pitt is too bland, and Jason Patrick isn't convincing at all.

    Sleepers is such a sleeper hit. It was released in '96, it was great, and everybody slept on it. I think I know why. It's a respectable sleeper mainly due to its personally private non-loud nature. The subject matter is saddening and stirring, and even outright sensitive, not very lively. While everyone you may talk to that's seen Sleepers loves and praises it, no one ever much talks about it. Just like Mystic River. Everyone you talk to that hasn't seen it, doesn't really know what it's about, just knows that Sleepers has a bunch of good actors in it. It coming out in 1996 also contributes. Sleepers plays in three distinct parts - the first introductory part showing the kids before the terrible incident is carefree and in a faster pace, the second story setting part taking place at the delinquent center is dismal, dragging and disturbing, and the third longest lasting part when the kids are adults is immersive, compelling, and the best part. The Sleepers' cast is great, Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman great, not even to mention Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver or Billy Crudup. Robert De Niro is at the top of his game and I'd be damned to critique him, there's nothing to critique. Hoffman's great as he nearly steals the whole show with his portrayal of drunken attorney Danny Snyder. Bacon is impressive in one of his most dominant roles. Brad Pitt really went for it with his character and he does a really good job. Jason Patric is strong and steady in his lead role. Minnie Driver is a sleeper actress as she is very well for Sleepers. Crudup is noticeably nice in his smaller role. The rest of the cast is completely rounded. Sleepers feels a little long but there's nothing close to being bad about it. While Sleepers may be somewhat slow, and put a few people to sleep, the collectiveness of the story is so agreeable it leaves a lasting impression on you.

    This is one of those movies that you don't forget. At least I didn't. When I sat down to re-watch it in 2013, I remembered how powerful it was when I saw it at the theater nearly 20 years earlier. You begin with a remarkable story, claimed by the author to be based on true events in his own life. Four childhood friends pull a prank that goes horribly wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent bystander. They are sent to reform school where there are repeatedly sexually and emotionally abused by several guards. We then fast-forward to when the boys are adults. One has become a lawyer, another has a low-level job at a newspaper, and the other two have become thugs. The thugs run into one of the guards at a bar and shoot him to death. Then the lawyer plots to get revenge against the other guards in the courtroom trial of the two thugs. And then you have a stellar cast. The child actors who portray the boys are flawless. Other key actors in key roles include Jason Patric (as one of the boys grown up), Minnie Driver as a friend of the boys since they were kids, Robert De Niro as the priest, Kevin Bacon as the main abusive guard, Jeffrey Donovan as another of the abusive guards, Terry Kinney as another of the abusive guards, Vittorio Gassman as a sort of godfather-like figure, and Dustin Hoffman as a broken down defense attorney. Ironically, the weakest performance in the film is by one of my favorite actors -- Brad Pitt. He's not at all convincing as a prosecuting attorney. And was he trying to talk like Marlon Brando??? And this was in the midst of what I consider to be Brad's finest period of acting. I can't explain it...but for me, his performance here just doesn't work. But we can still savor his other films from this time period, several of which are brilliant. Again, this is a powerful film with an absorbing story and generally fine acting. You'll note at the end that the "real" story is assessed from the point of view of the author and the authorities. Very interesting.

    When I first watched Barry Levinson's Sleepers, it traumatized me, as the horror of these young boys felt very real. The performances in this film are marvellous: Robert De Niro plays a likable, youthful priest who encourages a little misfit in the boys he looks over, but also tries to mould them into men who are prepared for the realities of life; Kevin Bacon knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of the sadistic, sick guard who watches the boys when they are sentenced to the boys detention centre in upstate New York, and even though it is tough to watch his character is played to perfection; when the boys grow up, we get some good turns from Jason Patric, Ron Eldard, Billy Crudup, and Brad Pitt, as scarred older men who all want some sort of justice for the abuse they suffered at the hands of guards when they were locked up. The story is great. We get a look into the lives of these boys before their incarceration, and then we see the repercussions of what happened to them while they were in the boys detention centre, which echo heavily through all their new lives. I felt much of the dialogue was very natural, and it never seemed to stray out of its world to make any grand statements; the script simply lets the story tell itself, and doesn't try to become an allegory for anything larger, which is totally fine because this plays as a dissection of how when a system fails to do what it is intended to do, those who have been damaged by that system end up either trying to tear it down, or using it against itself. It just lets the story happen, and this is how we come to understand its aim without any metaphors or parallels to anything else; sometimes simple works best. All in all I give this a 10 out of 10 stars because Sleepers is absolutely solid through and through. If only it could have been longer to get more of all the characters in, but there Levinson tells the story he wanted to, and I enjoy it every time I watch it over again.

    By this point, Sleepers is legendary, not only as a film that told of the shocking true story of abuse inside of juvenile prisons, but for launching the careers of some of today's best known stars. Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close.

    What a movie, I don't even know where to start. This movie is so touching and intriguing I could watch it every day and it would never get old. The movie has a great display of what it was like to live in hell's kitchen as a child. Then it shows horrible abuse and torture. The sad truth is that stuff happens all over the country in reform schools and not in them. It was a very tough place for the boys to live. Even thought they did commit a serious crime that punishment was not deserved at all. Then the great climax of the bar scene, which is one of my favorite scenes in all of movies. Then a courtroom drama that will want to make you cry making one of the boy's torturers admit the horrible truth. Then the touching scene which I won't go in to too much detail but the testimony of father Robert Carrillo. The whole movie is unbelievable and everybody played there roles great. Kevin Bacon was very convincing of the pedophile reform school guard. Robert De Niro played a big role and played it well. Although Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, and Jason Patric didn't play in the movie long it was long enough to show the great acting they all can perform. This movie was an excellent drama and more than worth giving it a try. With this all star cast, great plot, and great acting I am shocked this does not get more credit. Sleepers is truly a great film deserving a 10.

    This film is very well done, of course, being in the capable hands of Barry Levinson and a fantastic cast. I was pulled into it 100% until the trial. I find it not only hard to believe, but IMPOSSIBLE to believe, that any lawyer, under ANY circumstances, could ever have gotten the prison guard/witness/friend/co-worker of the murder victim to admit to the abuses that he committed (along with the murder victim) while a guard at the reform school. In my opinion, anyone as callous and cold-hearted as he was, as a multi-repeater rapist and torturer of children, wouldn't have even a shred of humanity left wherein he could be made to feel guilty in a court room. So that's where this movie fell apart for me.

    But, how can I rate a fictional story that is trying to pass itself off as a "true story" when everyone knows Hollywood wouldn't be faithful to a story if they swore on their mother's grave to do so! I have to give this more words than it deserves in order for it to qualify for a review. Why? Because I despise a story that is passed off as truth, when I've been around long enough to know that NOBODY in the movie industry cares one whit for the "truth." This industry is about money and power and that's it. I've seen too many times (AS IN EVERY TIME), when there really is a true story, and the author INSISTS that the movie stick to it faithfully, THEY NEVER DO! (Do your homework. It's a fact.) Let's do what the author and the screenwriter DID NOT do, and admit the motive for the book and the screenplay and the movie was first, MONEY! and secondly LOTS OF MONEY! Of course, after that, everyone wants a name for himself so he'll get paid better the next time around. Face reality. In Hollywood, the only time "truth" is really involved is when it's being hidden.

    I rate Sleepers with The Shawshank Redemption and October Sky as the best movies I have ever seen. The story is compelling and the characters and actors portraying them feel real. The direction is flawless but paced to ensure we the audience feel the various emotions depicted throughout the film. It is one of those rare movies you will enjoy more when you see it a second time. A special mention for Vittorio Gassman who plays the role of King Benny, one of the finest acting performances in the film which says a lot when you look at the cast. I do not think this movie received a single Oscar nomination. Maybe the content was considered too disturbing? Sleepers is a masterpiece and deserves a 10/10 rating.

    Adjectives such as compelling, suspenseful, mesmerizing, and haunting all apply with equal relevance to director Barry Levinson's serious-minded, tour de force tale of vengeance "Sleepers," starring Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patric, and Brad Pitt. The title comes from the street name for boys who have done time in juvenile lock-ups. Exploitative and depressing as the subject matter remains, "Sleepers" never stoops to vile instincts. Serving as his own scenarist, Levinson has woven an intricately designed yarn that unfurls like a Biblical epic. "Sleepers" charts the dire course of events when a winsome quartet of boys leaves the innocence of adolescence behind and plunges headlong into the fully blown evils of adulthood. Mind you, nothing lurid occurs on-screen. Compared with the Burt Reynolds & Jon Voight wilderness thriller "Deliverance," "Sleepers" seems almost tame in its depiction of evil. What takes place off-screen in this polished, downbeat film is what may disturb you. Adapted from Lorenzo Carcanterra's bestseller, "Sleepers' opens with a quaint bit of nostalgia. Audiences meet Lorenzo (Joe Perrino), Michael (Brad Renfro), John (Geoff Wigdor) and Tommy (Jonathan Tucker) and observe their lives in the tightly-knit sanctuary of New York City's Hell's Kitchen. Unspeakable horror derails the nostalgia and shatters their lives forever. Initially, Levinson appears to imitate Martin Scorsese. The film spans the late 1960s up the early 1970s as we follow the mischievous deeds of the four boys roaming those urban mean streets. Father Bobby (Robert De Niro of "Taxi Driver") is the sympathetic Catholic priest who befriends the boys and becomes their live-long confidant. One hot summer day, these reckless teens dream up a prank that nearly kills an innocent bystander. The court sentences them to a year in the Wilkinson Home of Boys reformatory. Before they've been locked up an hour, our protagonists realize the tragic mistake that they have made. They are beyond the protective confines of Hell's Kitchen and have fallen into a different kind of Hell. Sadistic guards led by smiling Sean Noyes (Kevin Bacon of "Footloose") prey on these defenseless minors. They rape and sodomize them on a regular basis in the dark cellars beneath the reformatory. Two of the four emerge the worse for their experiences. John Reilly (Ron Eldard of "Drop Dead Fred") and Tommy Marcano (Billy Crudup of "Watchmen") turn into armed and deadly street hoodlums who deal narcotics and act as assassins. Lorenzo (Jason Patric) and Michael (Brad Pitt) take the high road. One winds up at a newspaper while the other lands a post in the district attorney's office. The years elapse. One night John and Tommy spot Noyes in a neighborhood restaurant. After they refresh Noyes' memory, they gun him down in cold blood. When they are arrested for murder, childhood pal Michael volunteers to prosecute them. Witnesses can place them at the scene of the homicide, but the attorney decides to tip the scales of justice. Lorenzo and he contrive an elaborate scheme not only to win freedom for their friends but also pay back the despicable guard. Some critics have complained that Kevin Bacon's demise half-way through the story qualifies as anti-climactic. Nonsense!

Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close.

    What a movie, I don't even know where to start. This movie is so touching and intriguing I could watch it every day and it would never get old. The movie has a great display of what it was like to live in hell's kitchen as a child. Then it shows horrible abuse and torture. The sad truth is that stuff happens all over the country in reform schools and not in them. It was a very tough place for the boys to live. Even thought they did commit a serious crime that punishment was not deserved at all. Then the great climax of the bar scene, which is one of my favorite scenes in all of movies. Then a courtroom drama that will want to make you cry making one of the boy's torturers admit the horrible truth. Then the touching scene which I won't go in to too much detail but the testimony of father Robert Carrillo. The whole movie is unbelievable and everybody played there roles great. Kevin Bacon was very convincing of the pedophile reform school guard. Robert De Niro played a big role and played it well. Although Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, and Jason Patric didn't play in the movie long it was long enough to show the great acting they all can perform. This movie was an excellent drama and more than worth giving it a try. With this all star cast, great plot, and great acting I am shocked this does not get more credit. Sleepers is truly a great film deserving a 10.

    This film is very well done, of course, being in the capable hands of Barry Levinson and a fantastic cast. I was pulled into it 100% until the trial. I find it not only hard to believe, but IMPOSSIBLE to believe, that any lawyer, under ANY circumstances, could ever have gotten the prison guard/witness/friend/co-worker of the murder victim to admit to the abuses that he committed (along with the murder victim) while a guard at the reform school. In my opinion, anyone as callous and cold-hearted as he was, as a multi-repeater rapist and torturer of children, wouldn't have even a shred of humanity left wherein he could be made to feel guilty in a court room. So that's where this movie fell apart for me.

    But, how can I rate a fictional story that is trying to pass itself off as a "true story" when everyone knows Hollywood wouldn't be faithful to a story if they swore on their mother's grave to do so! I have to give this more words than it deserves in order for it to qualify for a review. Why? Because I despise a story that is passed off as truth, when I've been around long enough to know that NOBODY in the movie industry cares one whit for the "truth." This industry is about money and power and that's it. I've seen too many times (AS IN EVERY TIME), when there really is a true story, and the author INSISTS that the movie stick to it faithfully, THEY NEVER DO! (Do your homework. It's a fact.) Let's do what the author and the screenwriter DID NOT do, and admit the motive for the book and the screenplay and the movie was first, MONEY! and secondly LOTS OF MONEY! Of course, after that, everyone wants a name for himself so he'll get paid better the next time around. Face reality. In Hollywood, the only time "truth" is really involved is when it's being hidden.

    I rate Sleepers with The Shawshank Redemption and October Sky as the best movies I have ever seen. The story is compelling and the characters and actors portraying them feel real. The direction is flawless but paced to ensure we the audience feel the various emotions depicted throughout the film. It is one of those rare movies you will enjoy more when you see it a second time. A special mention for Vittorio Gassman who plays the role of King Benny, one of the finest acting performances in the film which says a lot when you look at the cast. I do not think this movie received a single Oscar nomination. Maybe the content was considered too disturbing? Sleepers is a masterpiece and deserves a 10/10 rating.

    Adjectives such as compelling, suspenseful, mesmerizing, and haunting all apply with equal relevance to director Barry Levinson's serious-minded, tour de force tale of vengeance "Sleepers," starring Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patric, and Brad Pitt. The title comes from the street name for boys who have done time in juvenile lock-ups. Exploitative and depressing as the subject matter remains, "Sleepers" never stoops to vile instincts. Serving as his own scenarist, Levinson has woven an intricately designed yarn that unfurls like a Biblical epic. "Sleepers" charts the dire course of events when a winsome quartet of boys leaves the innocence of adolescence behind and plunges headlong into the fully blown evils of adulthood. Mind you, nothing lurid occurs on-screen. Compared with the Burt Reynolds & Jon Voight wilderness thriller "Deliverance," "Sleepers" seems almost tame in its depiction of evil. What takes place off-screen in this polished, downbeat film is what may disturb you. Adapted from Lorenzo Carcanterra's bestseller, "Sleepers' opens with a quaint bit of nostalgia. Audiences meet Lorenzo (Joe Perrino), Michael (Brad Renfro), John (Geoff Wigdor) and Tommy (Jonathan Tucker) and observe their lives in the tightly-knit sanctuary of New York City's Hell's Kitchen. Unspeakable horror derails the nostalgia and shatters their lives forever. Initially, Levinson appears to imitate Martin Scorsese. The film spans the late 1960s up the early 1970s as we follow the mischievous deeds of the four boys roaming those urban mean streets. Father Bobby (Robert De Niro of "Taxi Driver") is the sympathetic Catholic priest who befriends the boys and becomes their live-long confidant. One hot summer day, these reckless teens dream up a prank that nearly kills an innocent bystander. The court sentences them to a year in the Wilkinson Home of Boys reformatory. Before they've been locked up an hour, our protagonists realize the tragic mistake that they have made. They are beyond the protective confines of Hell's Kitchen and have fallen into a different kind of Hell. Sadistic guards led by smiling Sean Noyes (Kevin Bacon of "Footloose") prey on these defenseless minors. They rape and sodomize them on a regular basis in the dark cellars beneath the reformatory. Two of the four emerge the worse for their experiences. John Reilly (Ron Eldard of "Drop Dead Fred") and Tommy Marcano (Billy Crudup of "Watchmen") turn into armed and deadly street hoodlums who deal narcotics and act as assassins. Lorenzo (Jason Patric) and Michael (Brad Pitt) take the high road. One winds up at a newspaper while the other lands a post in the district attorney's office. The years elapse. One night John and Tommy spot Noyes in a neighborhood restaurant. After they refresh Noyes' memory, they gun him down in cold blood. When they are arrested for murder, childhood pal Michael volunteers to prosecute them. Witnesses can place them at the scene of the homicide, but the attorney decides to tip the scales of justice. Lorenzo and he contrive an elaborate scheme not only to win freedom for their friends but also pay back the despicable guard. Some critics have complained that Kevin Bacon's demise half-way through the story qualifies as anti-climactic. Nonsense! "Sleepers" concerns friendship and how these friends with an entire community conspire to save John and Tommy. "Sleepers" invokes the vigilante justice formula of the recent John Grisham movie "A Time to Kill" in condoning the clear-cut murder of a repugnant individual. Director Barry Levinson has helmed several impressive films, but none compare with the hard-edged, clinical fatalism of this epic. "Sleepers" amounts to a stroll on the seamy side for the director of movies such as "Tin Men," "Rain Man," "Diner," "The Natural," "Bugsy," and "Disclosure." Meanwhile, "Sleepers' wallows in the ironic half-light of an amoral universe. Nevertheless, "Sleepers" is pure Levinson, from its 1960s era setting to the camaraderie of its leads. Levinson has fashioned a literate screenplay. During the first hour, he sets up his characters and explores the insular community of Hell's Kitchen. Everything here foreshadows the events which follows Noyes' murder. Levinson's tragedy is not so much about exorcising demons from their past as it is about heading off another catastrophe. Wisely, Levinson tones down the charisma that distinguishes his stellar cast of heartthrobs. As the shrewd assistant district attorney who orchestrates the cover-up in court, Pitt appears commendably taciturn though frayed in his shady effort to win justice for his childhood friends. Jason Patric is just guarded in his attitude but just as vindictive. Michael and Lorenzo both live out a vengeful fantasy as much a part of their Hell's Kitchen heritage as it is the Alexander Dumas novel "The Count of Monte Cristo" that he learned to savor at Wilkinson. Kevin Bacon endows his abusive prison guard with a cheerful decadence. You'll despise Bacon's depraved sentinel who is determined to teach his juvenile charges about rules and discipline. As Noyes' closet-cohort Ferguson, Terry Kinny has a devastating scene in court when he confesses his part in molesting these young men. Despite his short-time on screen, Dustin Hoffman dominates the action as an alcoholic, skid-row attorney who doubts his ability to acquit his guilty-as-sin clients. As stunning as "Sleepers" is, you may shy away from the experiencing its gritty realism more than once. Whether you skulk out of the movie feeling like a grimy, morally-bankrupt conspirator or trudge away from it with a world full of cynicism, you may have a difficult time either shrugging off or dismissing this evocative film.

    Sleepers is divided into two quite heterogeneous parts, where events are related in a rather heavy way by a continuous voice over, and through a direction that lacks a bit of ambition and that is sometimes too schmaltzy (emphatic shots, sad soundtrack). The first part is dark and terrifying with this gut-wrenching and poignant story that unfortunately certainly must have occurred more than once. The second part however struggles a bit more and is often a bit lengthy, despite some excellent scenes, mainly the ones at the courthouse. Most importantly, the vengeance scheme and the trial seem very far-fetched and very little credible, therefore inducing strong doubts about their veracity. As for the cast, it isn't as impressive as one could have thought in the first place. Apart from the excellent Kevin Bacon, no one really stands out: De Niro and Hoffman, though irreproachable, have too limited roles to be memorable, Pitt is too bland, and Jason Patrick isn't convincing at all.

    Sleepers is such a sleeper hit. It was released in '96, it was great, and everybody slept on it. I think I know why. It's a respectable sleeper mainly due to its personally private non-loud nature. The subject matter is saddening and stirring, and even outright sensitive, not very lively. While everyone you may talk to that's seen Sleepers loves and praises it, no one ever much talks about it. Just like Mystic River. Everyone you talk to that hasn't seen it, doesn't really know what it's about, just knows that Sleepers has a bunch of good actors in it. It coming out in 1996 also contributes. Sleepers plays in three distinct parts - the first introductory part showing the kids before the terrible incident is carefree and in a faster pace, the second story setting part taking place at the delinquent center is dismal, dragging and disturbing, and the third longest lasting part when the kids are adults is immersive, compelling, and the best part. The Sleepers' cast is great, Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman great, not even to mention Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver or Billy Crudup. Robert De Niro is at the top of his game and I'd be damned to critique him, there's nothing to critique. Hoffman's great as he nearly steals the whole show with his portrayal of drunken attorney Danny Snyder. Bacon is impressive in one of his most dominant roles. Brad Pitt really went for it with his character and he does a really good job. Jason Patric is strong and steady in his lead role. Minnie Driver is a sleeper actress as she is very well for Sleepers. Crudup is noticeably nice in his smaller role. The rest of the cast is completely rounded. Sleepers feels a little long but there's nothing close to being bad about it. While Sleepers may be somewhat slow, and put a few people to sleep, the collectiveness of the story is so agreeable it leaves a lasting impression on you.

    This is one of those movies that you don't forget. At least I didn't. When I sat down to re-watch it in 2013, I remembered how powerful it was when I saw it at the theater nearly 20 years earlier. You begin with a remarkable story, claimed by the author to be based on true events in his own life. Four childhood friends pull a prank that goes horribly wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent bystander. They are sent to reform school where there are repeatedly sexually and emotionally abused by several guards. We then fast-forward to when the boys are adults. One has become a lawyer, another has a low-level job at a newspaper, and the other two have become thugs. The thugs run into one of the guards at a bar and shoot him to death. Then the lawyer plots to get revenge against the other guards in the courtroom trial of the two thugs. And then you have a stellar cast. The child actors who portray the boys are flawless. Other key actors in key roles include Jason Patric (as one of the boys grown up), Minnie Driver as a friend of the boys since they were kids, Robert De Niro as the priest, Kevin Bacon as the main abusive guard, Jeffrey Donovan as another of the abusive guards, Terry Kinney as another of the abusive guards, Vittorio Gassman as a sort of godfather-like figure, and Dustin Hoffman as a broken down defense attorney. Ironically, the weakest performance in the film is by one of my favorite actors -- Brad Pitt. He's not at all convincing as a prosecuting attorney. And was he trying to talk like Marlon Brando??? And this was in the midst of what I consider to be Brad's finest period of acting. I can't explain it...but for me, his performance here just doesn't work. But we can still savor his other films from this time period, several of which are brilliant. Again, this is a powerful film with an absorbing story and generally fine acting. You'll note at the end that the "real" story is assessed from the point of view of the author and the authorities. Very interesting.

    When I first watched Barry Levinson's Sleepers, it traumatized me, as the horror of these young boys felt very real. The performances in this film are marvellous: Robert De Niro plays a likable, youthful priest who encourages a little misfit in the boys he looks over, but also tries to mould them into men who are prepared for the realities of life; Kevin Bacon knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of the sadistic, sick guard who watches the boys when they are sentenced to the boys detention centre in upstate New York, and even though it is tough to watch his character is played to perfection; when the boys grow up, we get some good turns from Jason Patric, Ron Eldard, Billy Crudup, and Brad Pitt, as scarred older men who all want some sort of justice for the abuse they suffered at the hands of guards when they were locked up. The story is great. We get a look into the lives of these boys before their incarceration, and then we see the repercussions of what happened to them while they were in the boys detention centre, which echo heavily through all their new lives. I felt much of the dialogue was very natural, and it never seemed to stray out of its world to make any grand statements; the script simply lets the story tell itself, and doesn't try to become an allegory for anything larger, which is totally fine because this plays as a dissection of how when a system fails to do what it is intended to do, those who have been damaged by that system end up either trying to tear it down, or using it against itself. It just lets the story happen, and this is how we come to understand its aim without any metaphors or parallels to anything else; sometimes simple works best. All in all I give this a 10 out of 10 stars because Sleepers is absolutely solid through and through. If only it could have been longer to get more of all the characters in, but there Levinson tells the story he wanted to, and I enjoy it every time I watch it over again.

As Noyes' closet-cohort Ferguson, Terry Kinny has a devastating scene in court when he confesses his part in molesting these young men. Despite his short-time on screen, Dustin Hoffman dominates the action as an alcoholic, skid-row attorney who doubts his ability to acquit his guilty-as-sin clients. As stunning as "Sleepers" is, you may shy away from the experiencing its gritty realism more than once. Whether you skulk out of the movie feeling like a grimy, morally-bankrupt conspirator or trudge away from it with a world full of cynicism, you may have a difficult time either shrugging off or dismissing this evocative film.

    Sleepers is divided into two quite heterogeneous parts, where events are related in a rather heavy way by a continuous voice over, and through a direction that lacks a bit of ambition and that is sometimes too schmaltzy (emphatic shots, sad soundtrack). The first part is dark and terrifying with this gut-wrenching and poignant story that unfortunately certainly must have occurred more than once. The second part however struggles a bit more and is often a bit lengthy, despite some excellent scenes, mainly the ones at the courthouse. Most importantly, the vengeance scheme and the trial seem very far-fetched and very little credible, therefore inducing strong doubts about their veracity. As for the cast, it isn't as impressive as one could have thought in the first place. Apart from the excellent Kevin Bacon, no one really stands out: De Niro and Hoffman, though irreproachable, have too limited roles to be memorable, Pitt is too bland, and Jason Patrick isn't convincing at all.

    Sleepers is such a sleeper hit. It was released in '96, it was great, and everybody slept on it. I think I know why. It's a respectable sleeper mainly due to its personally private non-loud nature. The subject matter is saddening and stirring, and even outright sensitive, not very lively. While everyone you may talk to that's seen Sleepers loves and praises it, no one ever much talks about it. Just like Mystic River. Everyone you talk to that hasn't seen it, doesn't really know what it's about, just knows that Sleepers has a bunch of good actors in it. It coming out in 1996 also contributes. Sleepers plays in three distinct parts - the first introductory part showing the kids before the terrible incident is carefree and in a faster pace, the second story setting part taking place at the delinquent center is dismal, dragging and disturbing, and the third longest lasting part when the kids are adults is immersive, compelling, and the best part. The Sleepers' cast is great, Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman great, not even to mention Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver or Billy Crudup. Robert De Niro is at the top of his game and I'd be damned to critique him, there's nothing to critique. Hoffman's great as he nearly steals the whole show with his portrayal of drunken attorney Danny Snyder. Bacon is impressive in one of his most dominant roles. Brad Pitt really went for it with his character and he does a really good job. Jason Patric is strong and steady in his lead role. Minnie Driver is a sleeper actress as she is very well for Sleepers. Crudup is noticeably nice in his smaller role. The rest of the cast is completely rounded. Sleepers feels a little long but there's nothing close to being bad about it. While Sleepers may be somewhat slow, and put a few people to sleep, the collectiveness of the story is so agreeable it leaves a lasting impression on you.

    This is one of those movies that you don't forget. At least I didn't. When I sat down to re-watch it in 2013, I remembered how powerful it was when I saw it at the theater nearly 20 years earlier. You begin with a remarkable story, claimed by the author to be based on true events in his own life. Four childhood friends pull a prank that goes horribly wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent bystander. They are sent to reform school where there are repeatedly sexually and emotionally abused by several guards. We then fast-forward to when the boys are adults. One has become a lawyer, another has a low-level job at a newspaper, and the other two have become thugs. The thugs run into one of the guards at a bar and shoot him to death. Then the lawyer plots to get revenge against the other guards in the courtroom trial of the two thugs. And then you have a stellar cast. The child actors who portray the boys are flawless. Other key actors in key roles include Jason Patric (as one of the boys grown up), Minnie Driver as a friend of the boys since they were kids, Robert De Niro as the priest, Kevin Bacon as the main abusive guard, Jeffrey Donovan as another of the abusive guards, Terry Kinney as another of the abusive guards, Vittorio Gassman as a sort of godfather-like figure, and Dustin Hoffman as a broken down defense attorney. Ironically, the weakest performance in the film is by one of my favorite actors -- Brad Pitt. He's not at all convincing as a prosecuting attorney. And was he trying to talk like Marlon Brando??? And this was in the midst of what I consider to be Brad's finest period of acting. I can't explain it...but for me, his performance here just doesn't work. But we can still savor his other films from this time period, several of which are brilliant. Again, this is a powerful film with an absorbing story and generally fine acting. You'll note at the end that the "real" story is assessed from the point of view of the author and the authorities. Very interesting.

    When I first watched Barry Levinson's Sleepers, it traumatized me, as the horror of these young boys felt very real. The performances in this film are marvellous: Robert De Niro plays a likable, youthful priest who encourages a little misfit in the boys he looks over, but also tries to mould them into men who are prepared for the realities of life; Kevin Bacon knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of the sadistic, sick guard who watches the boys when they are sentenced to the boys detention centre in upstate New York, and even though it is tough to watch his character is played to perfection; when the boys grow up, we get some good turns from Jason Patric, Ron Eldard, Billy Crudup, and Brad Pitt, as scarred older men who all want some sort of justice for the abuse they suffered at the hands of guards when they were locked up. The story is great. We get a look into the lives of these boys before their incarceration, and then we see the repercussions of what happened to them while they were in the boys detention centre, which echo heavily through all their new lives. I felt much of the dialogue was very natural, and it never seemed to stray out of its world to make any grand statements; the script simply lets the story tell itself, and doesn't try to become an allegory for anything larger, which is totally fine because this plays as a dissection of how when a system fails to do what it is intended to do, those who have been damaged by that system end up either trying to tear it down, or using it against itself. It just lets the story happen, and this is how we come to understand its aim without any metaphors or parallels to anything else; sometimes simple works best. All in all I give this a 10 out of 10 stars because Sleepers is absolutely solid through and through. If only it could have been longer to get more of all the characters in, but there Levinson tells the story he wanted to, and I enjoy it every time I watch it over again.

    By this point, Sleepers is legendary, not only as a film that told of the shocking true story of abuse inside of juvenile prisons, but for launching the careers of some of today's best known stars. Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close.

    What a movie, I don't even know where to start. This movie is so touching and intriguing I could watch it every day and it would never get old. The movie has a great display of what it was like to live in hell's kitchen as a child. Then it shows horrible abuse and torture. The sad truth is that stuff happens all over the country in reform schools and not in them. It was a very tough place for the boys to live. Even thought they did commit a serious crime that punishment was not deserved at all. Then the great climax of the bar scene, which is one of my favorite scenes in all of movies. Then a courtroom drama that will want to make you cry making one of the boy's torturers admit the horrible truth. Then the touching scene which I won't go in to too much detail but the testimony of father Robert Carrillo. The whole movie is unbelievable and everybody played there roles great. Kevin Bacon was very convincing of the pedophile reform school guard. Robert De Niro played a big role and played it well. Although Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, and Jason Patric didn't play in the movie long it was long enough to show the great acting they all can perform. This movie was an excellent drama and more than worth giving it a try. With this all star cast, great plot, and great acting I am shocked this does not get more credit. Sleepers is truly a great film deserving a 10.

    This film is very well done, of course, being in the capable hands of Barry Levinson and a fantastic cast. I was pulled into it 100% until the trial. I find it not only hard to believe, but IMPOSSIBLE to believe, that any lawyer, under ANY circumstances, could ever have gotten the prison guard/witness/friend/co-worker of the murder victim to admit to the abuses that he committed (along with the murder victim) while a guard at the reform school. In my opinion, anyone as callous and cold-hearted as he was, as a multi-repeater rapist and torturer of children, wouldn't have even a shred of humanity left wherein he could be made to feel guilty in a court room. So that's where this movie fell apart for me.

    But, how can I rate a fictional story that is trying to pass itself off as a "true story" when everyone knows Hollywood wouldn't be faithful to a story if they swore on their mother's grave to do so! I have to give this more words than it deserves in order for it to qualify for a review. Why? Because I despise a story that is passed off as truth, when I've been around long enough to know that NOBODY in the movie industry cares one whit for the "truth." This industry is about money and power and that's it. I've seen too many times (AS IN EVERY TIME), when there really is a true story, and the author INSISTS that the movie stick to it faithfully, THEY NEVER DO! (Do your homework. It's a fact.) Let's do what the author and the screenwriter DID NOT do, and admit the motive for the book and the screenplay and the movie was first, MONEY! and secondly LOTS OF MONEY! Of course, after that, everyone wants a name for himself so he'll get paid better the next time around. Face reality. In Hollywood, the only time "truth" is really involved is when it's being hidden.

    I rate Sleepers with The Shawshank Redemption and October Sky as the best movies I have ever seen. The story is compelling and the characters and actors portraying them feel real. The direction is flawless but paced to ensure we the audience feel the various emotions depicted throughout the film. It is one of those rare movies you will enjoy more when you see it a second time. A special mention for Vittorio Gassman who plays the role of King Benny, one of the finest acting performances in the film which says a lot when you look at the cast. I do not think this movie received a single Oscar nomination. Maybe the content was considered too disturbing? Sleepers is a masterpiece and deserves a 10/10 rating.
