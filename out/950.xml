    When I first saw this movie, Georgia, I was blown away by JJL's performance. Have always enjoyed Mare Winningham, she was excellent, as usual, as Georgia. I don't think there are many actors who could have played the role of Sadie, as layered as JJL did. When I first saw this movie I did a little bit in Internet research. I found out that the movie was written by JJL's mom, and I assume her daughter contributed. All of your previous comments are dead on; JJL should have received a Best Actress Oscar for her work, the contrasting musical styles and, the ever present sibling rivalry, not only in the style each character sings, or screams, as Sadie does, repeating the same word or sentiment over and over but how they live their lives.

    Jennifer Jason Leigh here pulls off another of her 'impossible' performances. Is there any film actress as versatile as she is? Is there anything she can't do or any role she cannot play? When she acts, she throws herself into the role with the force of an express train. Here she transforms into a hopeless, cheery, ever-smiling flop of a girl, who has failed at everything but just goes on in good humour, taking it on the chin from Life time after time. Her pathetic, sprawling, inept character is endlessly endearing, like a delightful child, even though she drives everyone she knows crazy because she is so hopeless. She can't stay off the drugs, or the booze, or out of bed with anyone for a quickie. She doesn't know when to start, she doesn't know when to stop. She is behaviour-dyslexic. Her thoroughly controlled and successful older sister gets her revenge on little sister by extending icy and permanent tolerance, disguising condescension as devotion. The two sisters are both singers, and the older one, Georgia of the title (though the star is really Sadie, the Leigh character), is a magnificent folk singer with a marvellously controlled and captivating voice (must get Winningham's CDs!). She is played brilliantly by Mare Willingham, who was justly nominated for an Oscar for it. As for Leigh, she won best actress awards from the New York Film Critics Circle Awards (highly prestigious in the USA), and the Montreal Film Festival. Leigh can sing better than she does in the film because it is part of the role that she must not be very good. However, she throws herself totally into every song she sings, and unbearably heart-rending emotion is her specialty. What a contrast to the cold control shown by her sister, who stands erect and formal, while Leigh throws herself all over the stage and repeatedly swallows and vomits up the microphone, and everything hangs out like long johns on the washing line which the neighbours don't want to see. The film is incredibly sensitive and profound, a triumph by Ulu Grosbard, who made too few films in his career, and is now well into his 80s. This is REAL film-making, and one of the endless parade of spectacular achievements by the incomparably brilliant Jennifer Jason Leigh, and surely one of her best.

    A grungy, indie-vibe movie about a wild child (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who has to fall back on her reliable sister (Mare Winningham) after she screws up her own life. Leigh's character loves her older sister precisely because she's always there for her, even as she dislikes how safe and boring her sister's life is. The film does a good job of tapping into the dynamic that exists between two people who both love and hate the very things that make them most different. Mare Winnigham received a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination for her performance, and she's good, but it's Jennifer Jason Leigh once again who proves that she was one of the most overlooked actresses of her generation. Grade: B

    Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role. Leigh, playing bar-band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, constantly leans on older sis Georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold. Perhaps due to her double duties as co-producer on the film, Leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner: she isn't credible as a singer and, even if this is intentional, gives herself far too much screen-time at the microphone. Probably hoping for a tour-de-force, Leigh is wire-drawn and nervous and jagged; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her). If Sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal, we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the (small) breaks that she does. As it is, the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim. Director Ulu Grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences, and the editing at the finale juxtaposes Sadie's bar performance with Georgia's sold-out arena show--both singing the same song--and it's a sadly nuanced moment...but really, what's the point? *1/2 from ****

    While I love Mare Winningham and Jennifer Jason Leigh, I felt terrible for the lead character of Sadie Flood who longs for the same success as her older married, conventional sister Georgia. The film earned nominations for Winningham who plays the role with understanding and grace like most of her performances. I just find it so sad for Sadie who is genuinely a tragic figure of a character who loves and is at loss about her relationship with Axel, a quiet pizza guy, who falls in love with her. I remember them hitch-hiking rather than ride in a car with Georgia and her husband. It is a sad, thoughtful movie about sibling rivalry and relationships.

    Hello, Brazilians! Georgia is such a touching film. I saw it once in one of the BAND's dawns, and then it didn't leave my mind anymore. After a long time, I saw it again, VHS, then I could remind it... still touching. A beautiful view of a beautiful life. Sadie is quite full of life. This life, sometimes, flees from her, but she's always trying to take it back. And there's no doubt about her ability... "She swallow people" - Georgia said. Yes, she's strong... she is Sadie Flood. And I really love this movie. I wish I could leave the Contracampo's (a Brazilian movie magazine)commentary here, but only English posts are accepted... what a pity!

    This is an independent drama featuring two sisters: Georgia a successful C&W singer and her younger sister Sadie who is a grunge rock chick and that's the story . When I say " story " I don't mean " plot " because unfortunately GEORGIA doesn't have a plot which is a shame since this movie falls short because of its low concept story . It's very well acted by all the cast and Marie Winningham was Oscar nominated as the title character while Jennifer Jason Leigh ( One of America's most underrated actresses of the last two decades ) is superb . Yeah you want to grab hold of Sadie and strangle some sense into her but having an abundance of reckless stupidity is how the character is written and Leigh plays her to perfection . it's just a shame that the film suffers from a lack of incidents in a tale featuring sibling rivalry with the most nail biting moment being when Sadie being refused on a plane because she has no shoes ! Will she get some footwear before the plane leaves ? That's the nearest we get to excitement

    'Georgia' is a strong, sometimes harrowing drama about the relationship between two singing siblings: the eponymous elder sister, an established country-folk star, and the less talented Sadie, who is actually the central character of this film. Jennifer Jason Leigh is in her element as the self-destructive, self-loathing Sadie, and delivers perhaps her finest performance; but Mare Willingham is also good in the subtler role of Georgia, a woman whose capacity to feel compassion has been tested to the limit, and which only survives when focused through a prism of superiority. Georgia is instinctively careful with words but Sadie compulsively goads her into betraying these instincts; the telling dialogues between them are constructed with a deadly precision, the high points of a generally excellent screenplay. What's also surprising is that the music is also good. In any film about art, a central problem for the director is creating a belief in the merits of the fictional work; in 'La Bellie Noiseuse', for example, Jean-Jacques Rivette created an explicit plot justification for not having to show the painting that is the film's centrepiece to his viewers, rather than letting us judge it. By contrast, in this film, Georgia sounds genuinely good, while Sadie veers between downright awful and almost interesting; this allows the film to actually use the music as a means of conveying the narrative of the story. This slows the pace of the film, and if you don't like the types of music played, might be excruciating; but it's interesting to see the (fictional) truth conveyed through the medium of performance. One of the film's strengths is that it grants us no indulgent fantasies; because of this, the narrative arc is limited (especially as the film is quite long). In some senses, the film resembles other great films about the self-destructive, like 'Five Easy Pieces' or 'Naked'. It's not quite in that class, but it's double-headed structure makes it more reflective, less visceral, but by no means uninteresting. Overall, it's an unjustly neglected work.

    Grosbard is my favorite director. Between "Georgia" and "True Confessions" I simply cannot imagine better motion pictures. "Georgia" has everything right - the right cast, the right details, the right decision to show the entire spectrum of the live music-making process. Grosbard is so correct in showing us the two sisters performing entire songs instead of using more cinematic fades to elapse time. This is about MUSICIANS and you have to show what it is they do, and Grosbard has the audacity to show it in real time. The last shot of Jennifer Jason-Leigh saluting the guy who bought her the shot of whiskey as she was performing brought tears to my eyes - not so much in empathy for her but in the realization that I had just seen a perfect work of art.

    Jennifer Jason Leigh here pulls off another of her 'impossible' performances. Is there any film actress as versatile as she is? Is there anything she can't do or any role she cannot play? When she acts, she throws herself into the role with the force of an express train. Here she transforms into a hopeless, cheery, ever-smiling flop of a girl, who has failed at everything but just goes on in good humour, taking it on the chin from Life time after time. Her pathetic, sprawling, inept character is endlessly endearing, like a delightful child, even though she drives everyone she knows crazy because she is so hopeless. She can't stay off the drugs, or the booze, or out of bed with anyone for a quickie. She doesn't know when to start, she doesn't know when to stop. She is behaviour-dyslexic. Her thoroughly controlled and successful older sister gets her revenge on little sister by extending icy and permanent tolerance, disguising condescension as devotion. The two sisters are both singers, and the older one, Georgia of the title (though the star is really Sadie, the Leigh character), is a magnificent folk singer with a marvellously controlled and captivating voice (must get Winningham's CDs!). She is played brilliantly by Mare Willingham, who was justly nominated for an Oscar for it. As for Leigh, she won best actress awards from the New York Film Critics Circle Awards (highly prestigious in the USA), and the Montreal Film Festival. Leigh can sing better than she does in the film because it is part of the role that she must not be very good. However, she throws herself totally into every song she sings, and unbearably heart-rending emotion is her specialty. What a contrast to the cold control shown by her sister, who stands erect and formal, while Leigh throws herself all over the stage and repeatedly swallows and vomits up the microphone, and everything hangs out like long johns on the washing line which the neighbours don't want to see. The film is incredibly sensitive and profound, a triumph by Ulu Grosbard, who made too few films in his career, and is now well into his 80s. This is REAL film-making, and one of the endless parade of spectacular achievements by the incomparably brilliant Jennifer Jason Leigh, and surely one of her best.

    A grungy, indie-vibe movie about a wild child (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who has to fall back on her reliable sister (Mare Winningham) after she screws up her own life. Leigh's character loves her older sister precisely because she's always there for her, even as she dislikes how safe and boring her sister's life is. The film does a good job of tapping into the dynamic that exists between two people who both love and hate the very things that make them most different. Mare Winnigham received a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination for her performance, and she's good, but it's Jennifer Jason Leigh once again who proves that she was one of the most overlooked actresses of her generation. Grade: B

    Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role. Leigh, playing bar-band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, constantly leans on older sis Georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold. Perhaps due to her double duties as co-producer on the film, Leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner: she isn't credible as a singer and, even if this is intentional, gives herself far too much screen-time at the microphone. Probably hoping for a tour-de-force, Leigh is wire-drawn and nervous and jagged; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her). If Sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal, we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the (small) breaks that she does. As it is, the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim. Director Ulu Grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences, and the editing at the finale juxtaposes Sadie's bar performance with Georgia's sold-out arena show--both singing the same song--and it's a sadly nuanced moment...but really, what's the point? *1/2 from ****

    While I love Mare Winningham and Jennifer Jason Leigh, I felt terrible for the lead character of Sadie Flood who longs for the same success as her older married, conventional sister Georgia. The film earned nominations for Winningham who plays the role with understanding and grace like most of her performances. I just find it so sad for Sadie who is genuinely a tragic figure of a character who loves and is at loss about her relationship with Axel, a quiet pizza guy, who falls in love with her. I remember them hitch-hiking rather than ride in a car with Georgia and her husband. It is a sad, thoughtful movie about sibling rivalry and relationships.

    Hello, Brazilians! Georgia is such a touching film. I saw it once in one of the BAND's dawns, and then it didn't leave my mind anymore. After a long time, I saw it again, VHS, then I could remind it... still touching. A beautiful view of a beautiful life. Sadie is quite full of life. This life, sometimes, flees from her, but she's always trying to take it back. And there's no doubt about her ability... "She swallow people" - Georgia said. Yes, she's strong... she is Sadie Flood. And I really love this movie. I wish I could leave the Contracampo's (a Brazilian movie magazine)commentary here, but only English posts are accepted... what a pity!

    This is an independent drama featuring two sisters: Georgia a successful C&W singer and her younger sister Sadie who is a grunge rock chick and that's the story . When I say " story " I don't mean " plot " because unfortunately GEORGIA doesn't have a plot which is a shame since this movie falls short because of its low concept story . It's very well acted by all the cast and Marie Winningham was Oscar nominated as the title character while Jennifer Jason Leigh ( One of America's most underrated actresses of the last two decades ) is superb . Yeah you want to grab hold of Sadie and strangle some sense into her but having an abundance of reckless stupidity is how the character is written and Leigh plays her to perfection . it's just a shame that the film suffers from a lack of incidents in a tale featuring sibling rivalry with the most nail biting moment being when Sadie being refused on a plane because she has no shoes ! Will she get some footwear before the plane leaves ? That's the nearest we get to excitement

    'Georgia' is a strong, sometimes harrowing drama about the relationship between two singing siblings: the eponymous elder sister, an established country-folk star, and the less talented Sadie, who is actually the central character of this film. Jennifer Jason Leigh is in her element as the self-destructive, self-loathing Sadie, and delivers perhaps her finest performance; but Mare Willingham is also good in the subtler role of Georgia, a woman whose capacity to feel compassion has been tested to the limit, and which only survives when focused through a prism of superiority. Georgia is instinctively careful with words but Sadie compulsively goads her into betraying these instincts; the telling dialogues between them are constructed with a deadly precision, the high points of a generally excellent screenplay. What's also surprising is that the music is also good. In any film about art, a central problem for the director is creating a belief in the merits of the fictional work; in 'La Bellie Noiseuse', for example, Jean-Jacques Rivette created an explicit plot justification for not having to show the painting that is the film's centrepiece to his viewers, rather than letting us judge it. By contrast, in this film, Georgia sounds genuinely good, while Sadie veers between downright awful and almost interesting; this allows the film to actually use the music as a means of conveying the narrative of the story. This slows the pace of the film, and if you don't like the types of music played, might be excruciating; but it's interesting to see the (fictional) truth conveyed through the medium of performance. One of the film's strengths is that it grants us no indulgent fantasies; because of this, the narrative arc is limited (especially as the film is quite long). In some senses, the film resembles other great films about the self-destructive, like 'Five Easy Pieces' or 'Naked'. It's not quite in that class, but it's double-headed structure makes it more reflective, less visceral, but by no means uninteresting. Overall, it's an unjustly neglected work.

    Grosbard is my favorite director. Between "Georgia" and "True Confessions" I simply cannot imagine better motion pictures. "Georgia" has everything right - the right cast, the right details, the right decision to show the entire spectrum of the live music-making process. Grosbard is so correct in showing us the two sisters performing entire songs instead of using more cinematic fades to elapse time. This is about MUSICIANS and you have to show what it is they do, and Grosbard has the audacity to show it in real time. The last shot of Jennifer Jason-Leigh saluting the guy who bought her the shot of whiskey as she was performing brought tears to my eyes - not so much in empathy for her but in the realization that I had just seen a perfect work of art.

    When I first saw this movie, Georgia, I was blown away by JJL's performance. Have always enjoyed Mare Winningham, she was excellent, as usual, as Georgia. I don't think there are many actors who could have played the role of Sadie, as layered as JJL did. When I first saw this movie I did a little bit in Internet research. I found out that the movie was written by JJL's mom, and I assume her daughter contributed. All of your previous comments are dead on; JJL should have received a Best Actress Oscar for her work, the contrasting musical styles and, the ever present sibling rivalry, not only in the style each character sings, or screams, as Sadie does, repeating the same word or sentiment over and over but how they live their lives.
