    If you're looking for an entertaining superhero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, The Shadow might just be it. The film is based on a character created in 1931, who first appeared in pulp novels and then in a popular radio show. Alec Baldwin plays Lamont Cranston aka The Shadow, a mysterious hero in 1930s New York City, who has psychic powers that allow him to control people's minds and appear invisible Â– except for his shadow. It's a cool concept. He's confronted by the villainous Shiwan Khan (played by John Lone of 'The Last Emperor'), the last descendant of Genghis Khan, who shares similar powers with Cranston and has a plot to conquer the world! Baldwin is smooth as The Shadow, but less so whenever he wears a long hair wig... I spent much of the time wondering whether Lone's beard was real or not. Either way, he looks a bit ridiculous as Khan. 'The Shadow' is so plain silly at times, that it's a little bit bad, but it's also funny. Much of it is an exercise in absurdity and I was half expecting the actors to suddenly burst out in laughter. But the bottom line is that I enjoyed watching it. The cast also includes Penelope Ann Miller, Ian McKellen and a kooky Tim Curry.

    Well, this film was on in the background on New Year's Eve 1997 in Copenhagen, when I took a phone call from what at that point I knew would be my future wife, I love old comic books, (although I'm not familiar with this particular character), like any other (relatively) young person in the 80's I've enjoyed a number of director Russell Mulcahy's music videos, heck, I even like the old Coasters hit "The Shadow Knows", so do you know what, I'm not going to be too harsh with my judgement. Yes, there are things not quite right with it, for one thing the title character's powers or their sources are never fully explained, he himself makes only fitful and to be honest rather underwhelming appearances when he does show up, plus most of all, John Lone as the Shadow's nemesis Khan is physically too small and cherubic-looking to impart any kind of old-fashioned dread. One scene where you see him from the back brushing past the NYC hordes in full war-attire had me tittering behind him. The main characters too, have little depth either, with none of the angst which fuels the more popular Batman or Spider Man characters. Better then to concentrate on the backgrounds, which are excellent, recreating the heady days of 1930's New York in all its glory and the special effects which are fine and entertaining. Director Mulcahy gives us some imaginative set-ups especially when his cameras go airborne. Lone apart, his Iead actors serve him well, Alec Baldwin and Penelope Ann Miller, playing their wonderful clothes well enough whilst Jerry Goldsmith's heavyweight score gives the movie some added grandeur. Slightly overlong and with too many gaps between stunts, nevertheless, the film is always good to look at even if the drama on screen occasionally slips shadow-like into the background.

    Exciting version of the popular comic books and broadcasting tale about the immortal crusader called &uml;The Shadow&uml; with very watchable FX and lots of fun .

Aided by companion Margo Lane (Penelope Anne Miller) and a Cabman (Peter Boyle) he battles super-criminal named Shiwan Khan (John Lone) . He discovers his destiny and a old legacy as a superhero called The Shadow , the invisible man who walks , a seemingly relentless crime fighter . A mask and raincoat he finds himself battling his nemesis , the deadliest descendant of Ghengis Khan . He's helped by an attractive woman and both of whom travel to dangerous streets N.Y. to thwart a nasty criminal . Khan is a cold and megalomaniac killer who murders cruelty his victims, he wants to take a power to dominate the world , he is supported by a particular ally , a smarmy villain (Tim Curry) and his hoodlums . The hero and villain have equal powers , yet the heroine can be hypnotised by one and no other . The picture charges into a tale of a hero who turned from evil in Tibet and reemerged in New York City as a superhero holding extraordinary power to fight in that most wretched lair if iniquity . As in 30's New York City, the Shadow battles his enemy who is building an atomic bomb. But the caped crusader is trapped inside a locked chamber being helped by his girlfriend . The Shadow is shown in this highly stylized big screen adaptation of the 30's radio show , the once starred by Orson Welles . Film gets exotic locations , derring-do adventures ,rip roaring , action-packed , tongue in check , it's a cinematic roller coaster pretty entertaining and with well made set pieces action , including numerous and elaborate FX . This exciting picture provides splendid production design by Joseph Nemec , while done more dynamically elsewhere , are fun and outstanding . This is an ambitious fantasy adventure with breathtaking special effects ; it has some well-staged scenes whose effectiveness owes much to Russell Mulcahy's strong pictorial sense . Older kids , teenagers may find the proceedings a bit hokey and paying little attention to logic , but everyone seems to be having a good time . The picture is a crossover among comic-strip hero , superhero feats , Saturday matin&eacute;e serials and old-fashioned thirties movies . As this runs like an old Republic serial of the thirties or Forties on a multi-million dollar budget . Its arresting visuals , lavish realization and crude energy put filmmaker Russell Mulcahy on the map . Much of the dialogue springs as if balloons from the printed page and the interpretation is appropriately rudimentary . The picture has great loads of action , special effects abundant , glamorous cinematography by Stephen Burum and spectacular Jerry Goldsmith's musical score , including an enjoyable leitmotif . The motion picture includes an interesting script by prestigious David Koepp and was rightly directed by Russell Mulcahy . Russell for some time worked in Britain as a filmmaker of video clips , but returned to his native country , Australia , to make his first fictional movie , &uml;Razorback&uml; . He was able to get the backing for what proved to be his greatest success &uml;Highlander&uml; . It led to two sequels , the first of which was realized by himself titled &uml;Quickening&uml; . He subsequently directed &uml;Resurrection&uml;with Charlie Sheen and &uml;Talos the mummy&uml; , among others . Despite major stars and big budgets with which to work have not fulfilled their potential and he seemed less commanding with players than with action . The flick will appeal to adventure fans and comic-books enthusiastic . Rating : Good and amusing. Well worth seeing.

    I remember Adam Baldwin was action man, first starring in Hunt for Red October which was very awesome and now in The Shadow. I remember when The Shadow came out, it didn't get too many good reviews and pretty much was lost. After watching the Last Emperor where John Lone was the main character, I decided to give The Shadow a chance. What I saw was an action movie that wasn't bad and was very entertaining. It surely wasn't going to win an Oscar, but I doubt anybody would wanna know more about The Shadow. Ian McKellan is also in the movie along with Tim Curry, what more fun can we ask? Penelope as the love interest wasn't all that bad although her career seems like to be limited to supporting cast and TV movie. The action and special effects were quite excellent for a fun movie. As a fun movie, this is how you should treat it as, just a fun movie.

    This movie is so bad that I watched it when it first came out and totally forgot about it. So much so, that I thought I found a 'superhero' movie that I had somehow missed. Baldwin is Baldwin. I wasn't expecting anything there. Knowing now that the guy hated on his daughter like an evil bully, its hard to forget what a schmuck he is when trying to escape reality for an hour and a half. The graphics are dated and obviously fake, the cast was the same from many other movies which gave it an even more obviously fake feel. The cheesiness of it is just dreadful. Seeing all the glowing remarks about it just confirms what I had already thought: you cannot trust the reviews on this site. Either they are all cheesy little lib-tard art-majors (also called 'unemployed'), or hacks for the companies that pump out this bile. Either way, skip this flick. Even if its free. If you decide to watch it and somehow find yourself liking it, please consider that your life is worthless and you should not be voting, breeding, or consuming oxygen around others. Seek professional help.

    This didn't start out like the typical superhero film. Insread doing something heroic, this film introduces the protagonist Lamont Cranston ordering the death of a rival. Cranston has been living in Tibet since the end of WWI and become a ruthless opium dealer and warlord called Yin-Ko (literally Dark Eagle in Mandarin Chinese.) He's abducted by servants of the Tulku. The Tulku, a holy man, sees the good in Cranston lurking beneath his evil persona, and tells Cranston he will be trained to use his darker nature to "cloud men's minds." Cranston isn't interested in redemption and even asks "Am I in hell" but is given no choice in the matter. Lamont Cranston gains psychic powers of hypnosis, invisibility, telepathy, and telekinesis as a result of his training. He returns to New York City where he becomes a fearsome vigilante called The Shadow while appearing to be a millionaire playboy. As The Shadow Lamont battles Shiwan Khan, an evil former student of the Tulku who overpowered and killed the holy man, and his plans for destroying New York while romancing Margo Lane, the daughter of a War Department scientist abducted by Khan. Margo Lane is a New York socialite whose father Reinhardt Lane was working on a device that could allow Khan to complete his plan. Margo also shows latent psychic ability in her telepathic connection to Lamont. This was a fun superhero film and Alec Baldwin does a very good job of portraying the Golden Age crime fighter on screen. The Shadow is somewhat similar to Batman in using his dark image to intimidate criminals but The Shadow's mission seems to be more about redemption rather than revenge. The Shadow unlike Batman doesn't hesitate to use lethal force to dispatch more dangerous criminals and isn't above using the lives of the people he saves by recruiting them to his own personal intelligence network. The special effects, set design, costumes all look wonderful and there's an excellent original score to go along. There's a style here that while not an authentic to recreate the look of the 1930's pays homage to it. Some of the supporting acting is a little underwhelming and for some reason the beard worn by John Lone looks like it came unglued but despite this The Shadow is a very good superhero movie that deserves a watch.

    I guess you can't fault the movie too much. The original superhero "The Shadow" was something cooped up in the 30s when the Far East was a mystical place where anything was possible. But the whole thing is ridiculous. The villain is a telepathic descendant of Genghis Khan and he fights with this American dude that in a 9 year span was a despotic warlord in China and also learned the mystical discipline that allows "clouding of the mind". Imagine a cross between The Golden Child, Darkman and the third installment of Highlander and you get this film. Only without the humor, horrific desperation and charm of either of them. Bottom line: a failed film, but one that paradoxically had good actors and a lot of potential. A lost one.

    To be perfectly honest, before I begin this review, I only started reading the DC and Marvel comics that involved Batman, Superman, Thor, Captain America, Green Lantern, and other superheroes, but I haven't read the pulp heroes like Phantom, Rocketeer, or Shadow at all because I was more of a 90s kid at the time and have watched some great stuff not only on TV, but at a movie theater as well. However, despite the issue I've already stated about not reading the Shadow comics, I heard that this flick was released the same year I was born even though I never saw aside from my childhood favorites. So, I watched this online, being interested and all that, and to my surprise, I was virtually impressed by the film's look and the main character being played by none other than Alec Baldwin, one of the most dramatic actors in cinema history and they made this look like a great film that should be watched again and again to die-hard Shadow fans even though I wasn't exactly one to begin with, anyway. The only flaw that prevented the film from receiving a much higher rating (not to mention, ruined it) for me, however, is the story. Now, I liked the concept from the earliest Shadow adventures being put into the script, but it didn't give some of the actors in this movie so much to do throughout the film and only focused on the main character and the main villain. With that flaw out of the way, the redeeming qualities made this film worth it. First of all, the visuals are nicely made. It has a 1930s feel to it with some dark areas and the setting in which the comics took place were magnificent. The cinematography is the epitome of brilliance and the direction from Russell Mulcahy is perfect and completely focused. The pacing is brisk, the script from David Koepp's pretty rich with solid dialog, and the action is pretty good too (especially the finale between the Shadow and Khan), but the strongest aspects goes to the brilliant special effects (I liked the invisible effects put into Alec Baldwin which is top notch), it's darker and atmospheric soundtrack from the late Jerry Goldsmith and an excellent cast to play their roles really well. Alec Baldwin did a fabulous job as the troubled Lamont Cranston and the Shadow as well (even his voice was not only creepy as the ghost, but epic with his laugh), and other cast members, although not given much to do, did great for what they were given. Tim Curry was enjoyable with his campy performance as a sidekick to Khan, Jonathan Winters was also enjoyable to see with a smaller role compared to the others, Ian McKellen is good too although not given much to do, Penelope Ann Miller did great as the love interest for Cranston named Margo, and John Lone did great as the evil Shiwan Khan. Overall, despite the mixed-to-negative reception it had with it first came out, like the Rocketeer and the Phantom, this is a heavily underrated coming from a guy who is born the year this was released in theaters and I'm hoping to watch it again quite soon. I've been hearing that there's gonna be a reboot of the Shadow even though this didn't get a franchise which is a shame. Besides, if it would ever get made, I will remember the lesson this movie did taught me: Who knows what evil lurks into the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!

    Excellent! Why are people so demanding with scripts when it comes to this kind of movies? This movie is for sheer entertainment only, not to get philosophical thesis from it. It won't give you any kind of revealing conclusions about the importance of the human race in the universe. It's a film that gives you solid entertainment from beginning to end and it does it with top qualities starting with the settings, all in the most perfect 1930s modern style, Art Deco night clubs, New York streets and traffic, its people walking by and the cars from that time. Women's clothes are smashing and the general atmosphere is very moody. The visual imagery is very imaginative and well executed with a perfect pacing for an action that never lets you down. I don't know if they made a sequel --the character is perfect for many sequels, since it is timeless-- but Alec Baldwin was perfect as The Shadow at the time of this production. I highly recommend this movie to let your imagination fly and have a good time imagining yourself in a 1930s New York, a mystified era that probably never existed the way it was portrayed here, so perfect and neat and surreal. But dreams are always nicer than harsh reality, aren't they?

    This didn't start out like the typical superhero film. Insread doing something heroic, this film introduces the protagonist Lamont Cranston ordering the death of a rival. Cranston has been living in Tibet since the end of WWI and become a ruthless opium dealer and warlord called Yin-Ko (literally Dark Eagle in Mandarin Chinese.) He's abducted by servants of the Tulku. The Tulku, a holy man, sees the good in Cranston lurking beneath his evil persona, and tells Cranston he will be trained to use his darker nature to "cloud men's minds." Cranston isn't interested in redemption and even asks "Am I in hell" but is given no choice in the matter. Lamont Cranston gains psychic powers of hypnosis, invisibility, telepathy, and telekinesis as a result of his training. He returns to New York City where he becomes a fearsome vigilante called The Shadow while appearing to be a millionaire playboy. As The Shadow Lamont battles Shiwan Khan, an evil former student of the Tulku who overpowered and killed the holy man, and his plans for destroying New York while romancing Margo Lane, the daughter of a War Department scientist abducted by Khan. Margo Lane is a New York socialite whose father Reinhardt Lane was working on a device that could allow Khan to complete his plan. Margo also shows latent psychic ability in her telepathic connection to Lamont. This was a fun superhero film and Alec Baldwin does a very good job of portraying the Golden Age crime fighter on screen. The Shadow is somewhat similar to Batman in using his dark image to intimidate criminals but The Shadow's mission seems to be more about redemption rather than revenge. The Shadow unlike Batman doesn't hesitate to use lethal force to dispatch more dangerous criminals and isn't above using the lives of the people he saves by recruiting them to his own personal intelligence network. The special effects, set design, costumes all look wonderful and there's an excellent original score to go along. There's a style here that while not an authentic to recreate the look of the 1930's pays homage to it. Some of the supporting acting is a little underwhelming and for some reason the beard worn by John Lone looks like it came unglued but despite this The Shadow is a very good superhero movie that deserves a watch.

    I guess you can't fault the movie too much. The original superhero "The Shadow" was something cooped up in the 30s when the Far East was a mystical place where anything was possible. But the whole thing is ridiculous. The villain is a telepathic descendant of Genghis Khan and he fights with this American dude that in a 9 year span was a despotic warlord in China and also learned the mystical discipline that allows "clouding of the mind". Imagine a cross between The Golden Child, Darkman and the third installment of Highlander and you get this film. Only without the humor, horrific desperation and charm of either of them. Bottom line: a failed film, but one that paradoxically had good actors and a lot of potential. A lost one.

    To be perfectly honest, before I begin this review, I only started reading the DC and Marvel comics that involved Batman, Superman, Thor, Captain America, Green Lantern, and other superheroes, but I haven't read the pulp heroes like Phantom, Rocketeer, or Shadow at all because I was more of a 90s kid at the time and have watched some great stuff not only on TV, but at a movie theater as well. However, despite the issue I've already stated about not reading the Shadow comics, I heard that this flick was released the same year I was born even though I never saw aside from my childhood favorites. So, I watched this online, being interested and all that, and to my surprise, I was virtually impressed by the film's look and the main character being played by none other than Alec Baldwin, one of the most dramatic actors in cinema history and they made this look like a great film that should be watched again and again to die-hard Shadow fans even though I wasn't exactly one to begin with, anyway. The only flaw that prevented the film from receiving a much higher rating (not to mention, ruined it) for me, however, is the story. Now, I liked the concept from the earliest Shadow adventures being put into the script, but it didn't give some of the actors in this movie so much to do throughout the film and only focused on the main character and the main villain. With that flaw out of the way, the redeeming qualities made this film worth it. First of all, the visuals are nicely made. It has a 1930s feel to it with some dark areas and the setting in which the comics took place were magnificent. The cinematography is the epitome of brilliance and the direction from Russell Mulcahy is perfect and completely focused. The pacing is brisk, the script from David Koepp's pretty rich with solid dialog, and the action is pretty good too (especially the finale between the Shadow and Khan), but the strongest aspects goes to the brilliant special effects (I liked the invisible effects put into Alec Baldwin which is top notch), it's darker and atmospheric soundtrack from the late Jerry Goldsmith and an excellent cast to play their roles really well. Alec Baldwin did a fabulous job as the troubled Lamont Cranston and the Shadow as well (even his voice was not only creepy as the ghost, but epic with his laugh), and other cast members, although not given much to do, did great for what they were given. Tim Curry was enjoyable with his campy performance as a sidekick to Khan, Jonathan Winters was also enjoyable to see with a smaller role compared to the others, Ian McKellen is good too although not given much to do, Penelope Ann Miller did great as the love interest for Cranston named Margo, and John Lone did great as the evil Shiwan Khan. Overall, despite the mixed-to-negative reception it had with it first came out, like the Rocketeer and the Phantom, this is a heavily underrated coming from a guy who is born the year this was released in theaters and I'm hoping to watch it again quite soon. I've been hearing that there's gonna be a reboot of the Shadow even though this didn't get a franchise which is a shame. Besides, if it would ever get made, I will remember the lesson this movie did taught me: Who knows what evil lurks into the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!

    Excellent! Why are people so demanding with scripts when it comes to this kind of movies? This movie is for sheer entertainment only, not to get philosophical thesis from it. It won't give you any kind of revealing conclusions about the importance of the human race in the universe. It's a film that gives you solid entertainment from beginning to end and it does it with top qualities starting with the settings, all in the most perfect 1930s modern style, Art Deco night clubs, New York streets and traffic, its people walking by and the cars from that time. Women's clothes are smashing and the general atmosphere is very moody. The visual imagery is very imaginative and well executed with a perfect pacing for an action that never lets you down. I don't know if they made a sequel --the character is perfect for many sequels, since it is timeless-- but Alec Baldwin was perfect as The Shadow at the time of this production. I highly recommend this movie to let your imagination fly and have a good time imagining yourself in a 1930s New York, a mystified era that probably never existed the way it was portrayed here, so perfect and neat and surreal. But dreams are always nicer than harsh reality, aren't they?

    If you're looking for an entertaining superhero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, The Shadow might just be it. The film is based on a character created in 1931, who first appeared in pulp novels and then in a popular radio show. Alec Baldwin plays Lamont Cranston aka The Shadow, a mysterious hero in 1930s New York City, who has psychic powers that allow him to control people's minds and appear invisible Â– except for his shadow. It's a cool concept. He's confronted by the villainous Shiwan Khan (played by John Lone of 'The Last Emperor'), the last descendant of Genghis Khan, who shares similar powers with Cranston and has a plot to conquer the world! Baldwin is smooth as The Shadow, but less so whenever he wears a long hair wig... I spent much of the time wondering whether Lone's beard was real or not. Either way, he looks a bit ridiculous as Khan. 'The Shadow' is so plain silly at times, that it's a little bit bad, but it's also funny. Much of it is an exercise in absurdity and I was half expecting the actors to suddenly burst out in laughter. But the bottom line is that I enjoyed watching it. The cast also includes Penelope Ann Miller, Ian McKellen and a kooky Tim Curry.

    Well, this film was on in the background on New Year's Eve 1997 in Copenhagen, when I took a phone call from what at that point I knew would be my future wife, I love old comic books, (although I'm not familiar with this particular character), like any other (relatively) young person in the 80's I've enjoyed a number of director Russell Mulcahy's music videos, heck, I even like the old Coasters hit "The Shadow Knows", so do you know what, I'm not going to be too harsh with my judgement. Yes, there are things not quite right with it, for one thing the title character's powers or their sources are never fully explained, he himself makes only fitful and to be honest rather underwhelming appearances when he does show up, plus most of all, John Lone as the Shadow's nemesis Khan is physically too small and cherubic-looking to impart any kind of old-fashioned dread. One scene where you see him from the back brushing past the NYC hordes in full war-attire had me tittering behind him. The main characters too, have little depth either, with none of the angst which fuels the more popular Batman or Spider Man characters. Better then to concentrate on the backgrounds, which are excellent, recreating the heady days of 1930's New York in all its glory and the special effects which are fine and entertaining. Director Mulcahy gives us some imaginative set-ups especially when his cameras go airborne. Lone apart, his Iead actors serve him well, Alec Baldwin and Penelope Ann Miller, playing their wonderful clothes well enough whilst Jerry Goldsmith's heavyweight score gives the movie some added grandeur. Slightly overlong and with too many gaps between stunts, nevertheless, the film is always good to look at even if the drama on screen occasionally slips shadow-like into the background.

    Exciting version of the popular comic books and broadcasting tale about the immortal crusader called &uml;The Shadow&uml; with very watchable FX and lots of fun . Several visual designs provide the highlights for those in the mood for a journey back to the radio past or a quick superhero adventure . As our stalwart hero , a billionaire playboy named Lamont Cranston (Alec Baldwin) is a master of illusion and defender of justice thanks to his alter ego . Aided by companion Margo Lane (Penelope Anne Miller) and a Cabman (Peter Boyle) he battles super-criminal named Shiwan Khan (John Lone) . He discovers his destiny and a old legacy as a superhero called The Shadow , the invisible man who walks , a seemingly relentless crime fighter . A mask and raincoat he finds himself battling his nemesis , the deadliest descendant of Ghengis Khan . He's helped by an attractive woman and both of whom travel to dangerous streets N.Y. to thwart a nasty criminal . Khan is a cold and megalomaniac killer who murders cruelty his victims, he wants to take a power to dominate the world , he is supported by a particular ally , a smarmy villain (Tim Curry) and his hoodlums . The hero and villain have equal powers , yet the heroine can be hypnotised by one and no other . The picture charges into a tale of a hero who turned from evil in Tibet and reemerged in New York City as a superhero holding extraordinary power to fight in that most wretched lair if iniquity . As in 30's New York City, the Shadow battles his enemy who is building an atomic bomb. But the caped crusader is trapped inside a locked chamber being helped by his girlfriend . The Shadow is shown in this highly stylized big screen adaptation of the 30's radio show , the once starred by Orson Welles . Film gets exotic locations , derring-do adventures ,rip roaring , action-packed , tongue in check , it's a cinematic roller coaster pretty entertaining and with well made set pieces action , including numerous and elaborate FX . This exciting picture provides splendid production design by Joseph Nemec , while done more dynamically elsewhere , are fun and outstanding . This is an ambitious fantasy adventure with breathtaking special effects ; it has some well-staged scenes whose effectiveness owes much to Russell Mulcahy's strong pictorial sense . Older kids , teenagers may find the proceedings a bit hokey and paying little attention to logic , but everyone seems to be having a good time . The picture is a crossover among comic-strip hero , superhero feats , Saturday matin&eacute;e serials and old-fashioned thirties movies . As this runs like an old Republic serial of the thirties or Forties on a multi-million dollar budget . Its arresting visuals , lavish realization and crude energy put filmmaker Russell Mulcahy on the map . Much of the dialogue springs as if balloons from the printed page and the interpretation is appropriately rudimentary . The picture has great loads of action , special effects abundant , glamorous cinematography by Stephen Burum and spectacular Jerry Goldsmith's musical score , including an enjoyable leitmotif . The motion picture includes an interesting script by prestigious David Koepp and was rightly directed by Russell Mulcahy . Russell for some time worked in Britain as a filmmaker of video clips , but returned to his native country , Australia , to make his first fictional movie , &uml;Razorback&uml; . He was able to get the backing for what proved to be his greatest success &uml;Highlander&uml; . It led to two sequels , the first of which was realized by himself titled &uml;Quickening&uml; . He subsequently directed &uml;Resurrection&uml;with Charlie Sheen and &uml;Talos the mummy&uml; , among others . Despite major stars and big budgets with which to work have not fulfilled their potential and he seemed less commanding with players than with action . The flick will appeal to adventure fans and comic-books enthusiastic . Rating : Good and amusing. Well worth seeing.

    I remember Adam Baldwin was action man, first starring in Hunt for Red October which was very awesome and now in The Shadow. I remember when The Shadow came out, it didn't get too many good reviews and pretty much was lost. After watching the Last Emperor where John Lone was the main character, I decided to give The Shadow a chance. What I saw was an action movie that wasn't bad and was very entertaining. It surely wasn't going to win an Oscar, but I doubt anybody would wanna know more about The Shadow. Ian McKellan is also in the movie along with Tim Curry, what more fun can we ask? Penelope as the love interest wasn't all that bad although her career seems like to be limited to supporting cast and TV movie. The action and special effects were quite excellent for a fun movie. As a fun movie, this is how you should treat it as, just a fun movie.

    This movie is so bad that I watched it when it first came out and totally forgot about it. So much so, that I thought I found a 'superhero' movie that I had somehow missed. Baldwin is Baldwin. I wasn't expecting anything there. Knowing now that the guy hated on his daughter like an evil bully, its hard to forget what a schmuck he is when trying to escape reality for an hour and a half. The graphics are dated and obviously fake, the cast was the same from many other movies which gave it an even more obviously fake feel. The cheesiness of it is just dreadful. Seeing all the glowing remarks about it just confirms what I had already thought: you cannot trust the reviews on this site. Either they are all cheesy little lib-tard art-majors (also called 'unemployed'), or hacks for the companies that pump out this bile. Either way, skip this flick. Even if its free. If you decide to watch it and somehow find yourself liking it, please consider that your life is worthless and you should not be voting, breeding, or consuming oxygen around others. Seek professional help.

    This didn't start out like the typical superhero film. Insread doing something heroic, this film introduces the protagonist Lamont Cranston ordering the death of a rival. Cranston has been living in Tibet since the end of WWI and become a ruthless opium dealer and warlord called Yin-Ko (literally Dark Eagle in Mandarin Chinese.) He's abducted by servants of the Tulku. The Tulku, a holy man, sees the good in Cranston lurking beneath his evil persona, and tells Cranston he will be trained to use his darker nature to "cloud men's minds." Cranston isn't interested in redemption and even asks "Am I in hell" but is given no choice in the matter. Lamont Cranston gains psychic powers of hypnosis, invisibility, telepathy, and telekinesis as a result of his training. He returns to New York City where he becomes a fearsome vigilante called The Shadow while appearing to be a millionaire playboy. As The Shadow Lamont battles Shiwan Khan, an evil former student of the Tulku who overpowered and killed the holy man, and his plans for destroying New York while romancing Margo Lane, the daughter of a War Department scientist abducted by Khan. Margo Lane is a New York socialite whose father Reinhardt Lane was working on a device that could allow Khan to complete his plan. Margo also shows latent psychic ability in her telepathic connection to Lamont. This was a fun superhero film and Alec Baldwin does a very good job of portraying the Golden Age crime fighter on screen.

    I remember Adam Baldwin was action man, first starring in Hunt for Red October which was very awesome and now in The Shadow. I remember when The Shadow came out, it didn't get too many good reviews and pretty much was lost. After watching the Last Emperor where John Lone was the main character, I decided to give The Shadow a chance. What I saw was an action movie that wasn't bad and was very entertaining. It surely wasn't going to win an Oscar, but I doubt anybody would wanna know more about The Shadow. Ian McKellan is also in the movie along with Tim Curry, what more fun can we ask? Penelope as the love interest wasn't all that bad although her career seems like to be limited to supporting cast and TV movie. The action and special effects were quite excellent for a fun movie. As a fun movie, this is how you should treat it as, just a fun movie.

    This movie is so bad that I watched it when it first came out and totally forgot about it. So much so, that I thought I found a 'superhero' movie that I had somehow missed. Baldwin is Baldwin. I wasn't expecting anything there. Knowing now that the guy hated on his daughter like an evil bully, its hard to forget what a schmuck he is when trying to escape reality for an hour and a half. The graphics are dated and obviously fake, the cast was the same from many other movies which gave it an even more obviously fake feel. The cheesiness of it is just dreadful. Seeing all the glowing remarks about it just confirms what I had already thought: you cannot trust the reviews on this site. Either they are all cheesy little lib-tard art-majors (also called 'unemployed'), or hacks for the companies that pump out this bile. Either way, skip this flick. Even if its free. If you decide to watch it and somehow find yourself liking it, please consider that your life is worthless and you should not be voting, breeding, or consuming oxygen around others. Seek professional help.

    This didn't start out like the typical superhero film. Insread doing something heroic, this film introduces the protagonist Lamont Cranston ordering the death of a rival. Cranston has been living in Tibet since the end of WWI and become a ruthless opium dealer and warlord called Yin-Ko (literally Dark Eagle in Mandarin Chinese.) He's abducted by servants of the Tulku. The Tulku, a holy man, sees the good in Cranston lurking beneath his evil persona, and tells Cranston he will be trained to use his darker nature to "cloud men's minds." Cranston isn't interested in redemption and even asks "Am I in hell" but is given no choice in the matter. Lamont Cranston gains psychic powers of hypnosis, invisibility, telepathy, and telekinesis as a result of his training. He returns to New York City where he becomes a fearsome vigilante called The Shadow while appearing to be a millionaire playboy. As The Shadow Lamont battles Shiwan Khan, an evil former student of the Tulku who overpowered and killed the holy man, and his plans for destroying New York while romancing Margo Lane, the daughter of a War Department scientist abducted by Khan. Margo Lane is a New York socialite whose father Reinhardt Lane was working on a device that could allow Khan to complete his plan. Margo also shows latent psychic ability in her telepathic connection to Lamont. This was a fun superhero film and Alec Baldwin does a very good job of portraying the Golden Age crime fighter on screen. The Shadow is somewhat similar to Batman in using his dark image to intimidate criminals but The Shadow's mission seems to be more about redemption rather than revenge. The Shadow unlike Batman doesn't hesitate to use lethal force to dispatch more dangerous criminals and isn't above using the lives of the people he saves by recruiting them to his own personal intelligence network. The special effects, set design, costumes all look wonderful and there's an excellent original score to go along. There's a style here that while not an authentic to recreate the look of the 1930's pays homage to it. Some of the supporting acting is a little underwhelming and for some reason the beard worn by John Lone looks like it came unglued but despite this The Shadow is a very good superhero movie that deserves a watch.

    I guess you can't fault the movie too much. The original superhero "The Shadow" was something cooped up in the 30s when the Far East was a mystical place where anything was possible. But the whole thing is ridiculous. The villain is a telepathic descendant of Genghis Khan and he fights with this American dude that in a 9 year span was a despotic warlord in China and also learned the mystical discipline that allows "clouding of the mind". Imagine a cross between The Golden Child, Darkman and the third installment of Highlander and you get this film. Only without the humor, horrific desperation and charm of either of them. Bottom line: a failed film, but one that paradoxically had good actors and a lot of potential. A lost one.

    To be perfectly honest, before I begin this review, I only started reading the DC and Marvel comics that involved Batman, Superman, Thor, Captain America, Green Lantern, and other superheroes, but I haven't read the pulp heroes like Phantom, Rocketeer, or Shadow at all because I was more of a 90s kid at the time and have watched some great stuff not only on TV, but at a movie theater as well. However, despite the issue I've already stated about not reading the Shadow comics, I heard that this flick was released the same year I was born even though I never saw aside from my childhood favorites. So, I watched this online, being interested and all that, and to my surprise, I was virtually impressed by the film's look and the main character being played by none other than Alec Baldwin, one of the most dramatic actors in cinema history and they made this look like a great film that should be watched again and again to die-hard Shadow fans even though I wasn't exactly one to begin with, anyway. The only flaw that prevented the film from receiving a much higher rating (not to mention, ruined it) for me, however, is the story. Now, I liked the concept from the earliest Shadow adventures being put into the script, but it didn't give some of the actors in this movie so much to do throughout the film and only focused on the main character and the main villain. With that flaw out of the way, the redeeming qualities made this film worth it. First of all, the visuals are nicely made. It has a 1930s feel to it with some dark areas and the setting in which the comics took place were magnificent. The cinematography is the epitome of brilliance and the direction from Russell Mulcahy is perfect and completely focused. The pacing is brisk, the script from David Koepp's pretty rich with solid dialog, and the action is pretty good too (especially the finale between the Shadow and Khan), but the strongest aspects goes to the brilliant special effects (I liked the invisible effects put into Alec Baldwin which is top notch), it's darker and atmospheric soundtrack from the late Jerry Goldsmith and an excellent cast to play their roles really well. Alec Baldwin did a fabulous job as the troubled Lamont Cranston and the Shadow as well (even his voice was not only creepy as the ghost, but epic with his laugh), and other cast members, although not given much to do, did great for what they were given. Tim Curry was enjoyable with his campy performance as a sidekick to Khan, Jonathan Winters was also enjoyable to see with a smaller role compared to the others, Ian McKellen is good too although not given much to do, Penelope Ann Miller did great as the love interest for Cranston named Margo, and John Lone did great as the evil Shiwan Khan. Overall, despite the mixed-to-negative reception it had with it first came out, like the Rocketeer and the Phantom, this is a heavily underrated coming from a guy who is born the year this was released in theaters and I'm hoping to watch it again quite soon. I've been hearing that there's gonna be a reboot of the Shadow even though this didn't get a franchise which is a shame. Besides, if it would ever get made, I will remember the lesson this movie did taught me: Who knows what evil lurks into the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!

    Excellent! Why are people so demanding with scripts when it comes to this kind of movies? This movie is for sheer entertainment only, not to get philosophical thesis from it. It won't give you any kind of revealing conclusions about the importance of the human race in the universe. It's a film that gives you solid entertainment from beginning to end and it does it with top qualities starting with the settings, all in the most perfect 1930s modern style, Art Deco night clubs, New York streets and traffic, its people walking by and the cars from that time. Women's clothes are smashing and the general atmosphere is very moody. The visual imagery is very imaginative and well executed with a perfect pacing for an action that never lets you down. I don't know if they made a sequel --the character is perfect for many sequels, since it is timeless-- but Alec Baldwin was perfect as The Shadow at the time of this production. I highly recommend this movie to let your imagination fly and have a good time imagining yourself in a 1930s New York, a mystified era that probably never existed the way it was portrayed here, so perfect and neat and surreal. But dreams are always nicer than harsh reality, aren't they?

    If you're looking for an entertaining superhero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, The Shadow might just be it. The film is based on a character created in 1931, who first appeared in pulp novels and then in a popular radio show. Alec Baldwin plays Lamont Cranston aka The Shadow, a mysterious hero in 1930s New York City, who has psychic powers that allow him to control people's minds and appear invisible Â– except for his shadow. It's a cool concept. He's confronted by the villainous Shiwan Khan (played by John Lone of 'The Last Emperor'), the last descendant of Genghis Khan, who shares similar powers with Cranston and has a plot to conquer the world! Baldwin is smooth as The Shadow, but less so whenever he wears a long hair wig... I spent much of the time wondering whether Lone's beard was real or not. Either way, he looks a bit ridiculous as Khan. 'The Shadow' is so plain silly at times, that it's a little bit bad, but it's also funny. Much of it is an exercise in absurdity and I was half expecting the actors to suddenly burst out in laughter. But the bottom line is that I enjoyed watching it. The cast also includes Penelope Ann Miller, Ian McKellen and a kooky Tim Curry.

    Well, this film was on in the background on New Year's Eve 1997 in Copenhagen, when I took a phone call from what at that point I knew would be my future wife, I love old comic books, (although I'm not familiar with this particular character), like any other (relatively) young person in the 80's I've enjoyed a number of director Russell Mulcahy's music videos, heck, I even like the old Coasters hit "The Shadow Knows", so do you know what, I'm not going to be too harsh with my judgement. Yes, there are things not quite right with it, for one thing the title character's powers or their sources are never fully explained, he himself makes only fitful and to be honest rather underwhelming appearances when he does show up, plus most of all, John Lone as the Shadow's nemesis Khan is physically too small and cherubic-looking to impart any kind of old-fashioned dread. One scene where you see him from the back brushing past the NYC hordes in full war-attire had me tittering behind him. The main characters too, have little depth either, with none of the angst which fuels the more popular Batman or Spider Man characters. Better then to concentrate on the backgrounds, which are excellent, recreating the heady days of 1930's New York in all its glory and the special effects which are fine and entertaining. Director Mulcahy gives us some imaginative set-ups especially when his cameras go airborne. Lone apart, his Iead actors serve him well, Alec Baldwin and Penelope Ann Miller, playing their wonderful clothes well enough whilst Jerry Goldsmith's heavyweight score gives the movie some added grandeur. Slightly overlong and with too many gaps between stunts, nevertheless, the film is always good to look at even if the drama on screen occasionally slips shadow-like into the background.

Tim Curry was enjoyable with his campy performance as a sidekick to Khan, Jonathan Winters was also enjoyable to see with a smaller role compared to the others, Ian McKellen is good too although not given much to do, Penelope Ann Miller did great as the love interest for Cranston named Margo, and John Lone did great as the evil Shiwan Khan. Overall, despite the mixed-to-negative reception it had with it first came out, like the Rocketeer and the Phantom, this is a heavily underrated coming from a guy who is born the year this was released in theaters and I'm hoping to watch it again quite soon. I've been hearing that there's gonna be a reboot of the Shadow even though this didn't get a franchise which is a shame. Besides, if it would ever get made, I will remember the lesson this movie did taught me: Who knows what evil lurks into the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!

    Excellent! Why are people so demanding with scripts when it comes to this kind of movies? This movie is for sheer entertainment only, not to get philosophical thesis from it. It won't give you any kind of revealing conclusions about the importance of the human race in the universe. It's a film that gives you solid entertainment from beginning to end and it does it with top qualities starting with the settings, all in the most perfect 1930s modern style, Art Deco night clubs, New York streets and traffic, its people walking by and the cars from that time. Women's clothes are smashing and the general atmosphere is very moody. The visual imagery is very imaginative and well executed with a perfect pacing for an action that never lets you down. I don't know if they made a sequel --the character is perfect for many sequels, since it is timeless-- but Alec Baldwin was perfect as The Shadow at the time of this production. I highly recommend this movie to let your imagination fly and have a good time imagining yourself in a 1930s New York, a mystified era that probably never existed the way it was portrayed here, so perfect and neat and surreal. But dreams are always nicer than harsh reality, aren't they?

    If you're looking for an entertaining superhero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, The Shadow might just be it. The film is based on a character created in 1931, who first appeared in pulp novels and then in a popular radio show. Alec Baldwin plays Lamont Cranston aka The Shadow, a mysterious hero in 1930s New York City, who has psychic powers that allow him to control people's minds and appear invisible Â– except for his shadow. It's a cool concept. He's confronted by the villainous Shiwan Khan (played by John Lone of 'The Last Emperor'), the last descendant of Genghis Khan, who shares similar powers with Cranston and has a plot to conquer the world! Baldwin is smooth as The Shadow, but less so whenever he wears a long hair wig... I spent much of the time wondering whether Lone's beard was real or not. Either way, he looks a bit ridiculous as Khan. 'The Shadow' is so plain silly at times, that it's a little bit bad, but it's also funny. Much of it is an exercise in absurdity and I was half expecting the actors to suddenly burst out in laughter. But the bottom line is that I enjoyed watching it. The cast also includes Penelope Ann Miller, Ian McKellen and a kooky Tim Curry.

    Well, this film was on in the background on New Year's Eve 1997 in Copenhagen, when I took a phone call from what at that point I knew would be my future wife, I love old comic books, (although I'm not familiar with this particular character), like any other (relatively) young person in the 80's I've enjoyed a number of director Russell Mulcahy's music videos, heck, I even like the old Coasters hit "The Shadow Knows", so do you know what, I'm not going to be too harsh with my judgement. Yes, there are things not quite right with it, for one thing the title character's powers or their sources are never fully explained, he himself makes only fitful and to be honest rather underwhelming appearances when he does show up, plus most of all, John Lone as the Shadow's nemesis Khan is physically too small and cherubic-looking to impart any kind of old-fashioned dread. One scene where you see him from the back brushing past the NYC hordes in full war-attire had me tittering behind him. The main characters too, have little depth either, with none of the angst which fuels the more popular Batman or Spider Man characters. Better then to concentrate on the backgrounds, which are excellent, recreating the heady days of 1930's New York in all its glory and the special effects which are fine and entertaining. Director Mulcahy gives us some imaginative set-ups especially when his cameras go airborne. Lone apart, his Iead actors serve him well, Alec Baldwin and Penelope Ann Miller, playing their wonderful clothes well enough whilst Jerry Goldsmith's heavyweight score gives the movie some added grandeur. Slightly overlong and with too many gaps between stunts, nevertheless, the film is always good to look at even if the drama on screen occasionally slips shadow-like into the background.

    Exciting version of the popular comic books and broadcasting tale about the immortal crusader called &uml;The Shadow&uml; with very watchable FX and lots of fun . Several visual designs provide the highlights for those in the mood for a journey back to the radio past or a quick superhero adventure .

Aided by companion Margo Lane (Penelope Anne Miller) and a Cabman (Peter Boyle) he battles super-criminal named Shiwan Khan (John Lone) . He discovers his destiny and a old legacy as a superhero called The Shadow , the invisible man who walks , a seemingly relentless crime fighter . A mask and raincoat he finds himself battling his nemesis , the deadliest descendant of Ghengis Khan . He's helped by an attractive woman and both of whom travel to dangerous streets N.Y. to thwart a nasty criminal . Khan is a cold and megalomaniac killer who murders cruelty his victims, he wants to take a power to dominate the world , he is supported by a particular ally , a smarmy villain (Tim Curry) and his hoodlums . The hero and villain have equal powers , yet the heroine can be hypnotised by one and no other . The picture charges into a tale of a hero who turned from evil in Tibet and reemerged in New York City as a superhero holding extraordinary power to fight in that most wretched lair if iniquity . As in 30's New York City, the Shadow battles his enemy who is building an atomic bomb. But the caped crusader is trapped inside a locked chamber being helped by his girlfriend . The Shadow is shown in this highly stylized big screen adaptation of the 30's radio show , the once starred by Orson Welles . Film gets exotic locations , derring-do adventures ,rip roaring , action-packed , tongue in check , it's a cinematic roller coaster pretty entertaining and with well made set pieces action , including numerous and elaborate FX . This exciting picture provides splendid production design by Joseph Nemec , while done more dynamically elsewhere , are fun and outstanding . This is an ambitious fantasy adventure with breathtaking special effects ; it has some well-staged scenes whose effectiveness owes much to Russell Mulcahy's strong pictorial sense . Older kids , teenagers may find the proceedings a bit hokey and paying little attention to logic , but everyone seems to be having a good time . The picture is a crossover among comic-strip hero , superhero feats , Saturday matin&eacute;e serials and old-fashioned thirties movies . As this runs like an old Republic serial of the thirties or Forties on a multi-million dollar budget . Its arresting visuals , lavish realization and crude energy put filmmaker Russell Mulcahy on the map . Much of the dialogue springs as if balloons from the printed page and the interpretation is appropriately rudimentary . The picture has great loads of action , special effects abundant , glamorous cinematography by Stephen Burum and spectacular Jerry Goldsmith's musical score , including an enjoyable leitmotif . The motion picture includes an interesting script by prestigious David Koepp and was rightly directed by Russell Mulcahy . Russell for some time worked in Britain as a filmmaker of video clips , but returned to his native country , Australia , to make his first fictional movie , &uml;Razorback&uml; . He was able to get the backing for what proved to be his greatest success &uml;Highlander&uml; . It led to two sequels , the first of which was realized by himself titled &uml;Quickening&uml; . He subsequently directed &uml;Resurrection&uml;with Charlie Sheen and &uml;Talos the mummy&uml; , among others . Despite major stars and big budgets with which to work have not fulfilled their potential and he seemed less commanding with players than with action .

    I remember Adam Baldwin was action man, first starring in Hunt for Red October which was very awesome and now in The Shadow. I remember when The Shadow came out, it didn't get too many good reviews and pretty much was lost. After watching the Last Emperor where John Lone was the main character, I decided to give The Shadow a chance. What I saw was an action movie that wasn't bad and was very entertaining. It surely wasn't going to win an Oscar, but I doubt anybody would wanna know more about The Shadow. Ian McKellan is also in the movie along with Tim Curry, what more fun can we ask? Penelope as the love interest wasn't all that bad although her career seems like to be limited to supporting cast and TV movie. The action and special effects were quite excellent for a fun movie. As a fun movie, this is how you should treat it as, just a fun movie.

    This movie is so bad that I watched it when it first came out and totally forgot about it. So much so, that I thought I found a 'superhero' movie that I had somehow missed. Baldwin is Baldwin. I wasn't expecting anything there. Knowing now that the guy hated on his daughter like an evil bully, its hard to forget what a schmuck he is when trying to escape reality for an hour and a half. The graphics are dated and obviously fake, the cast was the same from many other movies which gave it an even more obviously fake feel. The cheesiness of it is just dreadful. Seeing all the glowing remarks about it just confirms what I had already thought: you cannot trust the reviews on this site. Either they are all cheesy little lib-tard art-majors (also called 'unemployed'), or hacks for the companies that pump out this bile. Either way, skip this flick. Even if its free. If you decide to watch it and somehow find yourself liking it, please consider that your life is worthless and you should not be voting, breeding, or consuming oxygen around others. Seek professional help.

    This didn't start out like the typical superhero film. Insread doing something heroic, this film introduces the protagonist Lamont Cranston ordering the death of a rival. Cranston has been living in Tibet since the end of WWI and become a ruthless opium dealer and warlord called Yin-Ko (literally Dark Eagle in Mandarin Chinese.) He's abducted by servants of the Tulku. The Tulku, a holy man, sees the good in Cranston lurking beneath his evil persona, and tells Cranston he will be trained to use his darker nature to "cloud men's minds." Cranston isn't interested in redemption and even asks "Am I in hell" but is given no choice in the matter. Lamont Cranston gains psychic powers of hypnosis, invisibility, telepathy, and telekinesis as a result of his training. He returns to New York City where he becomes a fearsome vigilante called The Shadow while appearing to be a millionaire playboy. As The Shadow Lamont battles Shiwan Khan, an evil former student of the Tulku who overpowered and killed the holy man, and his plans for destroying New York while romancing Margo Lane, the daughter of a War Department scientist abducted by Khan. Margo Lane is a New York socialite whose father Reinhardt Lane was working on a device that could allow Khan to complete his plan. Margo also shows latent psychic ability in her telepathic connection to Lamont. This was a fun superhero film and Alec Baldwin does a very good job of portraying the Golden Age crime fighter on screen. The Shadow is somewhat similar to Batman in using his dark image to intimidate criminals but The Shadow's mission seems to be more about redemption rather than revenge. The Shadow unlike Batman doesn't hesitate to use lethal force to dispatch more dangerous criminals and isn't above using the lives of the people he saves by recruiting them to his own personal intelligence network. The special effects, set design, costumes all look wonderful and there's an excellent original score to go along. There's a style here that while not an authentic to recreate the look of the 1930's pays homage to it. Some of the supporting acting is a little underwhelming and for some reason the beard worn by John Lone looks like it came unglued but despite this The Shadow is a very good superhero movie that deserves a watch.

    I guess you can't fault the movie too much. The original superhero "The Shadow" was something cooped up in the 30s when the Far East was a mystical place where anything was possible. But the whole thing is ridiculous. The villain is a telepathic descendant of Genghis Khan and he fights with this American dude that in a 9 year span was a despotic warlord in China and also learned the mystical discipline that allows "clouding of the mind". Imagine a cross between The Golden Child, Darkman and the third installment of Highlander and you get this film. Only without the humor, horrific desperation and charm of either of them. Bottom line: a failed film, but one that paradoxically had good actors and a lot of potential. A lost one.

    To be perfectly honest, before I begin this review, I only started reading the DC and Marvel comics that involved Batman, Superman, Thor, Captain America, Green Lantern, and other superheroes, but I haven't read the pulp heroes like Phantom, Rocketeer, or Shadow at all because I was more of a 90s kid at the time and have watched some great stuff not only on TV, but at a movie theater as well. However, despite the issue I've already stated about not reading the Shadow comics, I heard that this flick was released the same year I was born even though I never saw aside from my childhood favorites. So, I watched this online, being interested and all that, and to my surprise, I was virtually impressed by the film's look and the main character being played by none other than Alec Baldwin, one of the most dramatic actors in cinema history and they made this look like a great film that should be watched again and again to die-hard Shadow fans even though I wasn't exactly one to begin with, anyway. The only flaw that prevented the film from receiving a much higher rating (not to mention, ruined it) for me, however, is the story. Now, I liked the concept from the earliest Shadow adventures being put into the script, but it didn't give some of the actors in this movie so much to do throughout the film and only focused on the main character and the main villain. With that flaw out of the way, the redeeming qualities made this film worth it. First of all, the visuals are nicely made. It has a 1930s feel to it with some dark areas and the setting in which the comics took place were magnificent. The cinematography is the epitome of brilliance and the direction from Russell Mulcahy is perfect and completely focused. The pacing is brisk, the script from David Koepp's pretty rich with solid dialog, and the action is pretty good too (especially the finale between the Shadow and Khan), but the strongest aspects goes to the brilliant special effects (I liked the invisible effects put into Alec Baldwin which is top notch), it's darker and atmospheric soundtrack from the late Jerry Goldsmith and an excellent cast to play their roles really well. Alec Baldwin did a fabulous job as the troubled Lamont Cranston and the Shadow as well (even his voice was not only creepy as the ghost, but epic with his laugh), and other cast members, although not given much to do, did great for what they were given. Tim Curry was enjoyable with his campy performance as a sidekick to Khan, Jonathan Winters was also enjoyable to see with a smaller role compared to the others, Ian McKellen is good too although not given much to do, Penelope Ann Miller did great as the love interest for Cranston named Margo, and John Lone did great as the evil Shiwan Khan. Overall, despite the mixed-to-negative reception it had with it first came out, like the Rocketeer and the Phantom, this is a heavily underrated coming from a guy who is born the year this was released in theaters and I'm hoping to watch it again quite soon. I've been hearing that there's gonna be a reboot of the Shadow even though this didn't get a franchise which is a shame. Besides, if it would ever get made, I will remember the lesson this movie did taught me: Who knows what evil lurks into the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!

    This movie is so bad that I watched it when it first came out and totally forgot about it. So much so, that I thought I found a 'superhero' movie that I had somehow missed. Baldwin is Baldwin. I wasn't expecting anything there. Knowing now that the guy hated on his daughter like an evil bully, its hard to forget what a schmuck he is when trying to escape reality for an hour and a half. The graphics are dated and obviously fake, the cast was the same from many other movies which gave it an even more obviously fake feel. The cheesiness of it is just dreadful. Seeing all the glowing remarks about it just confirms what I had already thought: you cannot trust the reviews on this site. Either they are all cheesy little lib-tard art-majors (also called 'unemployed'), or hacks for the companies that pump out this bile. Either way, skip this flick. Even if its free. If you decide to watch it and somehow find yourself liking it, please consider that your life is worthless and you should not be voting, breeding, or consuming oxygen around others. Seek professional help.

    This didn't start out like the typical superhero film. Insread doing something heroic, this film introduces the protagonist Lamont Cranston ordering the death of a rival. Cranston has been living in Tibet since the end of WWI and become a ruthless opium dealer and warlord called Yin-Ko (literally Dark Eagle in Mandarin Chinese.) He's abducted by servants of the Tulku. The Tulku, a holy man, sees the good in Cranston lurking beneath his evil persona, and tells Cranston he will be trained to use his darker nature to "cloud men's minds." Cranston isn't interested in redemption and even asks "Am I in hell" but is given no choice in the matter. Lamont Cranston gains psychic powers of hypnosis, invisibility, telepathy, and telekinesis as a result of his training. He returns to New York City where he becomes a fearsome vigilante called The Shadow while appearing to be a millionaire playboy. As The Shadow Lamont battles Shiwan Khan, an evil former student of the Tulku who overpowered and killed the holy man, and his plans for destroying New York while romancing Margo Lane, the daughter of a War Department scientist abducted by Khan. Margo Lane is a New York socialite whose father Reinhardt Lane was working on a device that could allow Khan to complete his plan. Margo also shows latent psychic ability in her telepathic connection to Lamont. This was a fun superhero film and Alec Baldwin does a very good job of portraying the Golden Age crime fighter on screen. The Shadow is somewhat similar to Batman in using his dark image to intimidate criminals but The Shadow's mission seems to be more about redemption rather than revenge. The Shadow unlike Batman doesn't hesitate to use lethal force to dispatch more dangerous criminals and isn't above using the lives of the people he saves by recruiting them to his own personal intelligence network. The special effects, set design, costumes all look wonderful and there's an excellent original score to go along. There's a style here that while not an authentic to recreate the look of the 1930's pays homage to it. Some of the supporting acting is a little underwhelming and for some reason the beard worn by John Lone looks like it came unglued but despite this The Shadow is a very good superhero movie that deserves a watch.

    I guess you can't fault the movie too much. The original superhero "The Shadow" was something cooped up in the 30s when the Far East was a mystical place where anything was possible. But the whole thing is ridiculous. The villain is a telepathic descendant of Genghis Khan and he fights with this American dude that in a 9 year span was a despotic warlord in China and also learned the mystical discipline that allows "clouding of the mind". Imagine a cross between The Golden Child, Darkman and the third installment of Highlander and you get this film. Only without the humor, horrific desperation and charm of either of them. Bottom line: a failed film, but one that paradoxically had good actors and a lot of potential. A lost one.

    To be perfectly honest, before I begin this review, I only started reading the DC and Marvel comics that involved Batman, Superman, Thor, Captain America, Green Lantern, and other superheroes, but I haven't read the pulp heroes like Phantom, Rocketeer, or Shadow at all because I was more of a 90s kid at the time and have watched some great stuff not only on TV, but at a movie theater as well. However, despite the issue I've already stated about not reading the Shadow comics, I heard that this flick was released the same year I was born even though I never saw aside from my childhood favorites. So, I watched this online, being interested and all that, and to my surprise, I was virtually impressed by the film's look and the main character being played by none other than Alec Baldwin, one of the most dramatic actors in cinema history and they made this look like a great film that should be watched again and again to die-hard Shadow fans even though I wasn't exactly one to begin with, anyway. The only flaw that prevented the film from receiving a much higher rating (not to mention, ruined it) for me, however, is the story. Now, I liked the concept from the earliest Shadow adventures being put into the script, but it didn't give some of the actors in this movie so much to do throughout the film and only focused on the main character and the main villain. With that flaw out of the way, the redeeming qualities made this film worth it. First of all, the visuals are nicely made. It has a 1930s feel to it with some dark areas and the setting in which the comics took place were magnificent. The cinematography is the epitome of brilliance and the direction from Russell Mulcahy is perfect and completely focused. The pacing is brisk, the script from David Koepp's pretty rich with solid dialog, and the action is pretty good too (especially the finale between the Shadow and Khan), but the strongest aspects goes to the brilliant special effects (I liked the invisible effects put into Alec Baldwin which is top notch), it's darker and atmospheric soundtrack from the late Jerry Goldsmith and an excellent cast to play their roles really well. Alec Baldwin did a fabulous job as the troubled Lamont Cranston and the Shadow as well (even his voice was not only creepy as the ghost, but epic with his laugh), and other cast members, although not given much to do, did great for what they were given. Tim Curry was enjoyable with his campy performance as a sidekick to Khan, Jonathan Winters was also enjoyable to see with a smaller role compared to the others, Ian McKellen is good too although not given much to do, Penelope Ann Miller did great as the love interest for Cranston named Margo, and John Lone did great as the evil Shiwan Khan. Overall, despite the mixed-to-negative reception it had with it first came out, like the Rocketeer and the Phantom, this is a heavily underrated coming from a guy who is born the year this was released in theaters and I'm hoping to watch it again quite soon. I've been hearing that there's gonna be a reboot of the Shadow even though this didn't get a franchise which is a shame. Besides, if it would ever get made, I will remember the lesson this movie did taught me: Who knows what evil lurks into the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!

    Excellent! Why are people so demanding with scripts when it comes to this kind of movies? This movie is for sheer entertainment only, not to get philosophical thesis from it. It won't give you any kind of revealing conclusions about the importance of the human race in the universe. It's a film that gives you solid entertainment from beginning to end and it does it with top qualities starting with the settings, all in the most perfect 1930s modern style, Art Deco night clubs, New York streets and traffic, its people walking by and the cars from that time. Women's clothes are smashing and the general atmosphere is very moody. The visual imagery is very imaginative and well executed with a perfect pacing for an action that never lets you down. I don't know if they made a sequel --the character is perfect for many sequels, since it is timeless-- but Alec Baldwin was perfect as The Shadow at the time of this production. I highly recommend this movie to let your imagination fly and have a good time imagining yourself in a 1930s New York, a mystified era that probably never existed the way it was portrayed here, so perfect and neat and surreal. But dreams are always nicer than harsh reality, aren't they?

    If you're looking for an entertaining superhero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, The Shadow might just be it. The film is based on a character created in 1931, who first appeared in pulp novels and then in a popular radio show. Alec Baldwin plays Lamont Cranston aka The Shadow, a mysterious hero in 1930s New York City, who has psychic powers that allow him to control people's minds and appear invisible Â– except for his shadow. It's a cool concept. He's confronted by the villainous Shiwan Khan (played by John Lone of 'The Last Emperor'), the last descendant of Genghis Khan, who shares similar powers with Cranston and has a plot to conquer the world! Baldwin is smooth as The Shadow, but less so whenever he wears a long hair wig... I spent much of the time wondering whether Lone's beard was real or not. Either way, he looks a bit ridiculous as Khan. 'The Shadow' is so plain silly at times, that it's a little bit bad, but it's also funny. Much of it is an exercise in absurdity and I was half expecting the actors to suddenly burst out in laughter. But the bottom line is that I enjoyed watching it. The cast also includes Penelope Ann Miller, Ian McKellen and a kooky Tim Curry.

    Well, this film was on in the background on New Year's Eve 1997 in Copenhagen, when I took a phone call from what at that point I knew would be my future wife, I love old comic books, (although I'm not familiar with this particular character), like any other (relatively) young person in the 80's I've enjoyed a number of director Russell Mulcahy's music videos, heck, I even like the old Coasters hit "The Shadow Knows", so do you know what, I'm not going to be too harsh with my judgement. Yes, there are things not quite right with it, for one thing the title character's powers or their sources are never fully explained, he himself makes only fitful and to be honest rather underwhelming appearances when he does show up, plus most of all, John Lone as the Shadow's nemesis Khan is physically too small and cherubic-looking to impart any kind of old-fashioned dread. One scene where you see him from the back brushing past the NYC hordes in full war-attire had me tittering behind him. The main characters too, have little depth either, with none of the angst which fuels the more popular Batman or Spider Man characters. Better then to concentrate on the backgrounds, which are excellent, recreating the heady days of 1930's New York in all its glory and the special effects which are fine and entertaining. Director Mulcahy gives us some imaginative set-ups especially when his cameras go airborne. Lone apart, his Iead actors serve him well, Alec Baldwin and Penelope Ann Miller, playing their wonderful clothes well enough whilst Jerry Goldsmith's heavyweight score gives the movie some added grandeur. Slightly overlong and with too many gaps between stunts, nevertheless, the film is always good to look at even if the drama on screen occasionally slips shadow-like into the background.

    Exciting version of the popular comic books and broadcasting tale about the immortal crusader called &uml;The Shadow&uml; with very watchable FX and lots of fun . Several visual designs provide the highlights for those in the mood for a journey back to the radio past or a quick superhero adventure . As our stalwart hero , a billionaire playboy named Lamont Cranston (Alec Baldwin) is a master of illusion and defender of justice thanks to his alter ego . Aided by companion Margo Lane (Penelope Anne Miller) and a Cabman (Peter Boyle) he battles super-criminal named Shiwan Khan (John Lone) . He discovers his destiny and a old legacy as a superhero called The Shadow , the invisible man who walks , a seemingly relentless crime fighter . A mask and raincoat he finds himself battling his nemesis , the deadliest descendant of Ghengis Khan . He's helped by an attractive woman and both of whom travel to dangerous streets N.Y. to thwart a nasty criminal . Khan is a cold and megalomaniac killer who murders cruelty his victims, he wants to take a power to dominate the world , he is supported by a particular ally , a smarmy villain (Tim Curry) and his hoodlums . The hero and villain have equal powers , yet the heroine can be hypnotised by one and no other . The picture charges into a tale of a hero who turned from evil in Tibet and reemerged in New York City as a superhero holding extraordinary power to fight in that most wretched lair if iniquity . As in 30's New York City, the Shadow battles his enemy who is building an atomic bomb. But the caped crusader is trapped inside a locked chamber being helped by his girlfriend . The Shadow is shown in this highly stylized big screen adaptation of the 30's radio show , the once starred by Orson Welles . Film gets exotic locations , derring-do adventures ,rip roaring , action-packed , tongue in check , it's a cinematic roller coaster pretty entertaining and with well made set pieces action , including numerous and elaborate FX . This exciting picture provides splendid production design by Joseph Nemec , while done more dynamically elsewhere , are fun and outstanding . This is an ambitious fantasy adventure with breathtaking special effects ; it has some well-staged scenes whose effectiveness owes much to Russell Mulcahy's strong pictorial sense . Older kids , teenagers may find the proceedings a bit hokey and paying little attention to logic , but everyone seems to be having a good time . The picture is a crossover among comic-strip hero , superhero feats , Saturday matin&eacute;e serials and old-fashioned thirties movies . As this runs like an old Republic serial of the thirties or Forties on a multi-million dollar budget . Its arresting visuals , lavish realization and crude energy put filmmaker Russell Mulcahy on the map . Much of the dialogue springs as if balloons from the printed page and the interpretation is appropriately rudimentary . The picture has great loads of action , special effects abundant , glamorous cinematography by Stephen Burum and spectacular Jerry Goldsmith's musical score , including an enjoyable leitmotif . The motion picture includes an interesting script by prestigious David Koepp and was rightly directed by Russell Mulcahy . Russell for some time worked in Britain as a filmmaker of video clips , but returned to his native country , Australia , to make his first fictional movie , &uml;Razorback&uml; . He was able to get the backing for what proved to be his greatest success &uml;Highlander&uml; . It led to two sequels , the first of which was realized by himself titled &uml;Quickening&uml; . He subsequently directed &uml;Resurrection&uml;with Charlie Sheen and &uml;Talos the mummy&uml; , among others . Despite major stars and big budgets with which to work have not fulfilled their potential and he seemed less commanding with players than with action . The flick will appeal to adventure fans and comic-books enthusiastic . Rating : Good and amusing. Well worth seeing.

    I remember Adam Baldwin was action man, first starring in Hunt for Red October which was very awesome and now in The Shadow. I remember when The Shadow came out, it didn't get too many good reviews and pretty much was lost. After watching the Last Emperor where John Lone was the main character, I decided to give The Shadow a chance. What I saw was an action movie that wasn't bad and was very entertaining. It surely wasn't going to win an Oscar, but I doubt anybody would wanna know more about The Shadow. Ian McKellan is also in the movie along with Tim Curry, what more fun can we ask? Penelope as the love interest wasn't all that bad although her career seems like to be limited to supporting cast and TV movie. The action and special effects were quite excellent for a fun movie. As a fun movie, this is how you should treat it as, just a fun movie.

    Well, this film was on in the background on New Year's Eve 1997 in Copenhagen, when I took a phone call from what at that point I knew would be my future wife, I love old comic books, (although I'm not familiar with this particular character), like any other (relatively) young person in the 80's I've enjoyed a number of director Russell Mulcahy's music videos, heck, I even like the old Coasters hit "The Shadow Knows", so do you know what, I'm not going to be too harsh with my judgement. Yes, there are things not quite right with it, for one thing the title character's powers or their sources are never fully explained, he himself makes only fitful and to be honest rather underwhelming appearances when he does show up, plus most of all, John Lone as the Shadow's nemesis Khan is physically too small and cherubic-looking to impart any kind of old-fashioned dread. One scene where you see him from the back brushing past the NYC hordes in full war-attire had me tittering behind him. The main characters too, have little depth either, with none of the angst which fuels the more popular Batman or Spider Man characters. Better then to concentrate on the backgrounds, which are excellent, recreating the heady days of 1930's New York in all its glory and the special effects which are fine and entertaining. Director Mulcahy gives us some imaginative set-ups especially when his cameras go airborne. Lone apart, his Iead actors serve him well, Alec Baldwin and Penelope Ann Miller, playing their wonderful clothes well enough whilst Jerry Goldsmith's heavyweight score gives the movie some added grandeur. Slightly overlong and with too many gaps between stunts, nevertheless, the film is always good to look at even if the drama on screen occasionally slips shadow-like into the background.

    I remember Adam Baldwin was action man, first starring in Hunt for Red October which was very awesome and now in The Shadow. I remember when The Shadow came out, it didn't get too many good reviews and pretty much was lost. After watching the Last Emperor where John Lone was the main character, I decided to give The Shadow a chance. What I saw was an action movie that wasn't bad and was very entertaining. It surely wasn't going to win an Oscar, but I doubt anybody would wanna know more about The Shadow. Ian McKellan is also in the movie along with Tim Curry, what more fun can we ask? Penelope as the love interest wasn't all that bad although her career seems like to be limited to supporting cast and TV movie. The action and special effects were quite excellent for a fun movie. As a fun movie, this is how you should treat it as, just a fun movie.

    This movie is so bad that I watched it when it first came out and totally forgot about it. So much so, that I thought I found a 'superhero' movie that I had somehow missed. Baldwin is Baldwin. I wasn't expecting anything there. Knowing now that the guy hated on his daughter like an evil bully, its hard to forget what a schmuck he is when trying to escape reality for an hour and a half. The graphics are dated and obviously fake, the cast was the same from many other movies which gave it an even more obviously fake feel. The cheesiness of it is just dreadful. Seeing all the glowing remarks about it just confirms what I had already thought: you cannot trust the reviews on this site. Either they are all cheesy little lib-tard art-majors (also called 'unemployed'), or hacks for the companies that pump out this bile. Either way, skip this flick. Even if its free. If you decide to watch it and somehow find yourself liking it, please consider that your life is worthless and you should not be voting, breeding, or consuming oxygen around others. Seek professional help.

    This didn't start out like the typical superhero film. Insread doing something heroic, this film introduces the protagonist Lamont Cranston ordering the death of a rival. Cranston has been living in Tibet since the end of WWI and become a ruthless opium dealer and warlord called Yin-Ko (literally Dark Eagle in Mandarin Chinese.) He's abducted by servants of the Tulku. The Tulku, a holy man, sees the good in Cranston lurking beneath his evil persona, and tells Cranston he will be trained to use his darker nature to "cloud men's minds." Cranston isn't interested in redemption and even asks "Am I in hell" but is given no choice in the matter. Lamont Cranston gains psychic powers of hypnosis, invisibility, telepathy, and telekinesis as a result of his training. He returns to New York City where he becomes a fearsome vigilante called The Shadow while appearing to be a millionaire playboy. As The Shadow Lamont battles Shiwan Khan, an evil former student of the Tulku who overpowered and killed the holy man, and his plans for destroying New York while romancing Margo Lane, the daughter of a War Department scientist abducted by Khan. Margo Lane is a New York socialite whose father Reinhardt Lane was working on a device that could allow Khan to complete his plan. Margo also shows latent psychic ability in her telepathic connection to Lamont. This was a fun superhero film and Alec Baldwin does a very good job of portraying the Golden Age crime fighter on screen. The Shadow is somewhat similar to Batman in using his dark image to intimidate criminals but The Shadow's mission seems to be more about redemption rather than revenge. The Shadow unlike Batman doesn't hesitate to use lethal force to dispatch more dangerous criminals and isn't above using the lives of the people he saves by recruiting them to his own personal intelligence network. The special effects, set design, costumes all look wonderful and there's an excellent original score to go along. There's a style here that while not an authentic to recreate the look of the 1930's pays homage to it. Some of the supporting acting is a little underwhelming and for some reason the beard worn by John Lone looks like it came unglued but despite this The Shadow is a very good superhero movie that deserves a watch.

    I guess you can't fault the movie too much. The original superhero "The Shadow" was something cooped up in the 30s when the Far East was a mystical place where anything was possible. But the whole thing is ridiculous. The villain is a telepathic descendant of Genghis Khan and he fights with this American dude that in a 9 year span was a despotic warlord in China and also learned the mystical discipline that allows "clouding of the mind". Imagine a cross between The Golden Child, Darkman and the third installment of Highlander and you get this film. Only without the humor, horrific desperation and charm of either of them. Bottom line: a failed film, but one that paradoxically had good actors and a lot of potential. A lost one.

    To be perfectly honest, before I begin this review, I only started reading the DC and Marvel comics that involved Batman, Superman, Thor, Captain America, Green Lantern, and other superheroes, but I haven't read the pulp heroes like Phantom, Rocketeer, or Shadow at all because I was more of a 90s kid at the time and have watched some great stuff not only on TV, but at a movie theater as well. However, despite the issue I've already stated about not reading the Shadow comics, I heard that this flick was released the same year I was born even though I never saw aside from my childhood favorites. So, I watched this online, being interested and all that, and to my surprise, I was virtually impressed by the film's look and the main character being played by none other than Alec Baldwin, one of the most dramatic actors in cinema history and they made this look like a great film that should be watched again and again to die-hard Shadow fans even though I wasn't exactly one to begin with, anyway. The only flaw that prevented the film from receiving a much higher rating (not to mention, ruined it) for me, however, is the story. Now, I liked the concept from the earliest Shadow adventures being put into the script, but it didn't give some of the actors in this movie so much to do throughout the film and only focused on the main character and the main villain. With that flaw out of the way, the redeeming qualities made this film worth it. First of all, the visuals are nicely made. It has a 1930s feel to it with some dark areas and the setting in which the comics took place were magnificent. The cinematography is the epitome of brilliance and the direction from Russell Mulcahy is perfect and completely focused. The pacing is brisk, the script from David Koepp's pretty rich with solid dialog, and the action is pretty good too (especially the finale between the Shadow and Khan), but the strongest aspects goes to the brilliant special effects (I liked the invisible effects put into Alec Baldwin which is top notch), it's darker and atmospheric soundtrack from the late Jerry Goldsmith and an excellent cast to play their roles really well. Alec Baldwin did a fabulous job as the troubled Lamont Cranston and the Shadow as well (even his voice was not only creepy as the ghost, but epic with his laugh), and other cast members, although not given much to do, did great for what they were given. Tim Curry was enjoyable with his campy performance as a sidekick to Khan, Jonathan Winters was also enjoyable to see with a smaller role compared to the others, Ian McKellen is good too although not given much to do, Penelope Ann Miller did great as the love interest for Cranston named Margo, and John Lone did great as the evil Shiwan Khan. Overall, despite the mixed-to-negative reception it had with it first came out, like the Rocketeer and the Phantom, this is a heavily underrated coming from a guy who is born the year this was released in theaters and I'm hoping to watch it again quite soon. I've been hearing that there's gonna be a reboot of the Shadow even though this didn't get a franchise which is a shame. Besides, if it would ever get made, I will remember the lesson this movie did taught me: Who knows what evil lurks into the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!

    Excellent! Why are people so demanding with scripts when it comes to this kind of movies? This movie is for sheer entertainment only, not to get philosophical thesis from it. It won't give you any kind of revealing conclusions about the importance of the human race in the universe. It's a film that gives you solid entertainment from beginning to end and it does it with top qualities starting with the settings, all in the most perfect 1930s modern style, Art Deco night clubs, New York streets and traffic, its people walking by and the cars from that time. Women's clothes are smashing and the general atmosphere is very moody. The visual imagery is very imaginative and well executed with a perfect pacing for an action that never lets you down. I don't know if they made a sequel --the character is perfect for many sequels, since it is timeless-- but Alec Baldwin was perfect as The Shadow at the time of this production. I highly recommend this movie to let your imagination fly and have a good time imagining yourself in a 1930s New York, a mystified era that probably never existed the way it was portrayed here, so perfect and neat and surreal. But dreams are always nicer than harsh reality, aren't they?

    If you're looking for an entertaining superhero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, The Shadow might just be it. The film is based on a character created in 1931, who first appeared in pulp novels and then in a popular radio show. Alec Baldwin plays Lamont Cranston aka The Shadow, a mysterious hero in 1930s New York City, who has psychic powers that allow him to control people's minds and appear invisible Â– except for his shadow. It's a cool concept. He's confronted by the villainous Shiwan Khan (played by John Lone of 'The Last Emperor'), the last descendant of Genghis Khan, who shares similar powers with Cranston and has a plot to conquer the world! Baldwin is smooth as The Shadow, but less so whenever he wears a long hair wig... I spent much of the time wondering whether Lone's beard was real or not. Either way, he looks a bit ridiculous as Khan. 'The Shadow' is so plain silly at times, that it's a little bit bad, but it's also funny. Much of it is an exercise in absurdity and I was half expecting the actors to suddenly burst out in laughter. But the bottom line is that I enjoyed watching it. The cast also includes Penelope Ann Miller, Ian McKellen and a kooky Tim Curry.

However, despite the issue I've already stated about not reading the Shadow comics, I heard that this flick was released the same year I was born even though I never saw aside from my childhood favorites. So, I watched this online, being interested and all that, and to my surprise, I was virtually impressed by the film's look and the main character being played by none other than Alec Baldwin, one of the most dramatic actors in cinema history and they made this look like a great film that should be watched again and again to die-hard Shadow fans even though I wasn't exactly one to begin with, anyway. The only flaw that prevented the film from receiving a much higher rating (not to mention, ruined it) for me, however, is the story. Now, I liked the concept from the earliest Shadow adventures being put into the script, but it didn't give some of the actors in this movie so much to do throughout the film and only focused on the main character and the main villain. With that flaw out of the way, the redeeming qualities made this film worth it. First of all, the visuals are nicely made. It has a 1930s feel to it with some dark areas and the setting in which the comics took place were magnificent. The cinematography is the epitome of brilliance and the direction from Russell Mulcahy is perfect and completely focused. The pacing is brisk, the script from David Koepp's pretty rich with solid dialog, and the action is pretty good too (especially the finale between the Shadow and Khan), but the strongest aspects goes to the brilliant special effects (I liked the invisible effects put into Alec Baldwin which is top notch), it's darker and atmospheric soundtrack from the late Jerry Goldsmith and an excellent cast to play their roles really well. Alec Baldwin did a fabulous job as the troubled Lamont Cranston and the Shadow as well (even his voice was not only creepy as the ghost, but epic with his laugh), and other cast members, although not given much to do, did great for what they were given. Tim Curry was enjoyable with his campy performance as a sidekick to Khan, Jonathan Winters was also enjoyable to see with a smaller role compared to the others, Ian McKellen is good too although not given much to do, Penelope Ann Miller did great as the love interest for Cranston named Margo, and John Lone did great as the evil Shiwan Khan. Overall, despite the mixed-to-negative reception it had with it first came out, like the Rocketeer and the Phantom, this is a heavily underrated coming from a guy who is born the year this was released in theaters and I'm hoping to watch it again quite soon. I've been hearing that there's gonna be a reboot of the Shadow even though this didn't get a franchise which is a shame. Besides, if it would ever get made, I will remember the lesson this movie did taught me: Who knows what evil lurks into the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!

    Excellent! Why are people so demanding with scripts when it comes to this kind of movies? This movie is for sheer entertainment only, not to get philosophical thesis from it. It won't give you any kind of revealing conclusions about the importance of the human race in the universe. It's a film that gives you solid entertainment from beginning to end and it does it with top qualities starting with the settings, all in the most perfect 1930s modern style, Art Deco night clubs, New York streets and traffic, its people walking by and the cars from that time. Women's clothes are smashing and the general atmosphere is very moody. The visual imagery is very imaginative and well executed with a perfect pacing for an action that never lets you down. I don't know if they made a sequel --the character is perfect for many sequels, since it is timeless-- but Alec Baldwin was perfect as The Shadow at the time of this production. I highly recommend this movie to let your imagination fly and have a good time imagining yourself in a 1930s New York, a mystified era that probably never existed the way it was portrayed here, so perfect and neat and surreal. But dreams are always nicer than harsh reality, aren't they?
