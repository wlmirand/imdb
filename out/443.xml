 <sinopse>
  A wealthy San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people there in increasing numbers and with increasing viciousness.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Melanie Daniels is the modern rich socialite, part of the jet-set who always gets what she wants. When lawyer Mitch Brenner sees her in a pet shop, he plays something of a practical joke on her, and she decides to return the favor. She drives about an hour north of San Francisco to Bodega Bay, where Mitch spends the weekends with his mother Lydia and younger sister Cathy. Soon after her arrival, however, the birds in the area begin to act strangely. A seagull attacks Melanie as she is crossing the bay in a small boat, and then, Lydia finds her neighbor dead, obviously the victim of a bird attack. Soon, birds in the hundreds and thousands are attacking anyone they find out of doors. There is no explanation as to why this might be happening, and as the birds continue their vicious attacks, survival becomes the priority.

    I've never seen it before and was expecting it to be amazing and scary. My favorite movie is Rear Window, so I know I like his movies, but this was ridiculous and not at all scary. The beginning was exhausting and too much setup. The acting was melodramatic and we literally laughed at times. The writing was horrible and forced. The worst was probably when, near the end of the movie, Melanie (Tippi Hedron) was sitting on the couch curling up into a ball because they here the birds trying to get into the house. Just seemed like either bad acting or bad direction by Hitchcock. I'm gonna guess bad direction because Tippi was a fairly good actress through most of the movie. Oh and the scene where she is attacked in the room! Why would you go in there and then when you're in there getting attacked, why wouldn't you scream? Ugh! Sorry the whole movie annoyed me! Don't waste your time.

    I was looking for a movie to watch and this one caught my eye because of Alfred Hitchcock. It's a long movie, about 2 hours and it really takes you for a wonderful ride. I wasn't bored at any part. The movie starts off as a sort of quirky romantic comedy, perfectly played by Tippi Hedren. Nobody else could have done a better job and that's why I scoff at any remake of this movie. Every scene was perfectly done and you'll probably spend a lot of time smiling (especially at the beginning). Part way through the movie turns into a drama, which I usually don't like - but I love this film in every way. Finally the movie turns into a heart pounding thriller as the birds begin to cause havoc on the beautiful town of Bodega Bay (which is a real place by the way). I won't spoil the ending for you, but if you love movies, this will become one of your favorites.

    Just got done with The Birds movie by Alfred Hitchcock. Had heard about it so finally got my hands on. Its filled with absurd logic of Birds attacking humans for no reason which is so chaotic when you are in the middle of the movie. As the story progressed it had vivid touch of thrill and how nature as in mother nature termed as god can take decisions on its hands when it disapproves of a decision of a human. But why affect the whole Bodega Bay. A very different concept which opens up mind to possibilities which are still yet to be interpreted. I still feel this movie had more to offer but it was stopped at the right time before the concept went off hand. But nevertheless class scenes and cutting edge direction by the great master of suspense.

    As Mark Twain once said, classic is something everyone wants to have read without having to read it, referring to books. The quote is very suitable nowadays for films, especially those regarded as classics. Classic films are usually praised and hailed as masterpieces especially by those who have never seen them. I do not know weather that is the case with Alfred Joseph Hitchcock's ''The Birds'', but ''The Birds'', despite its suspenseful moments, collapses under its weak foundations. ''The Birds'' is not a flawless film. In fact, it fails on many levels, particularly on the acting, the screenplay and the directing. To begin with, the acting in the film is atrocious, mainly from its main cast. Tippi Herden's acting is absolutely horrendous, as she apparently doesn't know how to react to any situation. When something bad happens she reacts scared and when something good happens she reacts happily as if nothing has happened a few minutes ago. She tries to give a sympathetic and somewhat comical performance to portray her good old fashioned nice and naive character but fails completely and instead gives a very annoying performance. With Hedren, you can always see she is acting rather than portraying realistically: her lines are very well rehearsed and she tries to add a little sauce to her performance by talking fast or moving her head in a strange manner, all of which betray her in the end. When the birds attack she looks horrified but afterwards, during her brief conversations with Rod Taylor, she acts as if nothing has happened, talking in a very calm and ordinary way. At the end, all she succeeds is delivering a completely unrealistic and dull performance. Rod Taylor is no better, as is Veronica Cartwright, who portrays his sister. Now, some child actors can be horrendous while others can be amazing. Cartwright's acting belongs in the first category. Jessica Tandy is the only exception in the film's cast who gives a decent performance, overshadowing her co-stars in every scene. Tandy, actually, is the only character who is believable in the film, confirming us that's its a horror film rather than a comedy. The technical parts of the film are good, especially the visual effects by Iwerks and the rapid editing. As for Mr. Hitchcock, apparently he hasn't decided where the film takes place as half of the characters are British (speaking in British accent too) while the others are American. And I don't think they speak British in California. Finally, the ending needed a little work, as by the end of the film one realizes that all the action (thus the entire film) has been pointless, meaning that there is no final redemption. Overall, the film fails to be scary, suspenseful or philosophical (if that's what it wanted to be) and succeeds in being ludicrous.

    . . . can be found right here in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 opus, THE BIRDS. In fact, if you put THE BIRDS side-by-side with ALL of the movies based on King's writings to date, it's hard to believe that there is another classic out there that has so many hallmarks of what today is known as the Stephen King story style. Essentially, THE BIRDS invented Stephen King. Nature run amok. Can you say Cujo? The holy roller tourist mother in the diner going berserk, and blaming visitor Melanie for the rampaging gulls (a delicious irony on Hitchcock's part, since the traveling mom is an outsider herself! The sanctimonious people come up as weak links again and again in King-based works). The Rube Goldberg machine-type scenario leading to one kind of disaster morphing into an even worse apocalyptic horse of a different color, with the exploding gas station and cars. Haven't we seen the exact same thing happen in countless King tales? The quirky egghead (an ornithologist spinster here) and the drunken "doomsayer"--both in the crab shack scenes--get kidnapped to the East Coast in nearly every King screenplay. If you want to see the earliest Stephen King movie, watch THE BIRDS.

    I may be in the minority, but I feel that "The Birds" was Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. The basic premise of the movie is as compelling as any can be; the feathered creatures in the trees and in the sky, which we all take for granted, suddenly begin acting strangely, attacking humans. Tippi Hedren is incomparably lovely as the heroine. One can understand why the sexually frustrated Hitchcock was so obsessed with her. But she's not mere candy for the eyes; Hedren turns in a compelling, underrated performance. Rod Taylor is fine, but is overshadowed by the stunning Hedren, who steals every scene she's in. One of the most memorable, visually impactful scenes in the history of cinema occurs in "The Birds," when Tippi Hedren sits down on a bench at the school playground to smoke a cigarette, and a huge number of birds, with eerie silence, gradually gather on the monkey bars behind her. Another classic moment comes in the diner, where the patrons express the growing panic of the sleepy little community, and an elderly woman, who is an ornithologist, defends the birds, and regarding any war with them, declares, "Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance!" There is a bit too much gore in the film for my taste, and the ending has always struck me as unsatisfying, but overall "The Birds" is a brilliant piece of work, by one of the all time greatest directors.

    A rich woman goes to a small coast town after a man she saw on a pet shop. Her arrival, however, coincides with strange happenings in the city as the birds gradually start attacking everyone. I was attracted by it because of its status as a 'classical horror', appearing in many listings as one of the best horror films, and the fact it's made by Alfred Hitchcock. I can't understand all the hype. Ed Wood made better films. This film is so bad, most of the 'scary' scenes actually had me laughing. No just the 'that is too silly' laugh, but the 'I almost fell out of my chair laughing' laugh; nothing short of Monty Python or Chaplin have ever made me laugh this much. I showed this film to some of my family; the adults were mostly shaking their heads and questioning how Hitchcock could have success with something like this, while the younger ones (10-14 years old) were laughing and later said it was the best comedy they ever watched. The acting is beyond amateurish, with characters mostly making faces to the camera and shrieking to convey their shock being something straight out of a bad parody. It also shocks me that Hitchcock, who always cast beautiful women like Ingrid Bergman, Vera Miles or Grace Kelly to star in his films, would cast the rather ugly Tippi Hedren. Was there no beautiful/cute blondes available? The characters are not far behind with their terrible development, being pretty much caricatures of human beings; Hedren's character being the worst offender, with her motivations or actions. They also act inexplicably dumb at times: Hedren's reaction to the birds in the school being the best example, but also the information given by the radio news. The special effects are terrible. Not just the usual background scenes, but the birds and their attacks are laughably badly done. Suspension of disbelief can only work so far; in here, the birds looked like bad puppets with the way they moved. I fell laughing at most 'attack' scenes, with the gas station one being my favorite. The fact this was Oscar-nominated is nothing short of a joke, you could find better effects in the silent era four decades before this. But the very worst of all is the story itself. Hitchcock always managed to make his stories have a degree of sense, even his most fantastic tales like 'North by Northwest'. That doesn't happen here. There is no explanation at hand, not even a hint for us to go by. Even horrors like George Romero's zombies or crap like 'The Mist' leave a hint for us to work on, to base ourselves. Hitchcock offers nothing at all. He explained that, by giving a reason, the movie would turn into science-fiction; clearly, he must either be an idiot or not understand horror at all. This is a terrible, nonsensical film that should be on par with the likes of 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' or 'Battlefield Earth'. It is as if Ed Wood himself wrote/directed/produced.

    The Birds: I've always been aware of the existence of The Birds and the reputation it held amongst Hitchcock fans. I was not ready for how fantastic it actually is. I was terrified during the film, absolutely frightened by the mere sight of a bird. The build-up is what makes every moment as scary as its reputation says it is. You have the empty feeling that grows in your stomach when you know something is going to happen, and then when the birds would finally take action, I literally shuttered and flinched. I felt like the birds attacking me as I was watching it, I could feel them digging into my skin because the atmosphere is created so well. Hitchcock once said it was the most terrifying movie he's ever made, he was correct. The special effects of the birds are something quite remarkable for its time, unbelievably believable. The Birds takes it time to develop the storyline, but I never lost interest. The script fully realizes and understands its characters, just as good, if not better than any other Hitchcock picture. Tippi Hedren is phenomenal as the lead in the film. My favorite Hitchcock lady. She's not the typical heroine, she has rough, unpolished edges to her, but she makes the movie all the more engaging. I loved every second of The Birds, though the one compliant I have is that it feels a manipulative many times using children as the targets of the birds. I thought Hedren's scenes were better. It doesn't detract much from a excellent horror movie. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A+

    This was the first Hitchcock movie I saw, and up until the last 15 minutes of it I thought it was a good movie. When you see it in the the 21st Century you have to think though out the movie that it was made in the '60s and that's why not everything is quite the way one would have wanted it.. The acting was mostly good and most part of the scenes had great camera angles and light etcetera. The only bad thing about the movie was, like stated above, the last 15 minutes of the film. Why did she go in to the room, instead of just peeking in? Why did she not put up more of a fight with the birds? Why did the birds to this? And why so many different birds? And what happened after they drove off? I H.A.T.E. having questions instead of answers at the end of a movie.

They also act inexplicably dumb at times: Hedren's reaction to the birds in the school being the best example, but also the information given by the radio news. The special effects are terrible. Not just the usual background scenes, but the birds and their attacks are laughably badly done. Suspension of disbelief can only work so far; in here, the birds looked like bad puppets with the way they moved. I fell laughing at most 'attack' scenes, with the gas station one being my favorite. The fact this was Oscar-nominated is nothing short of a joke, you could find better effects in the silent era four decades before this. But the very worst of all is the story itself. Hitchcock always managed to make his stories have a degree of sense, even his most fantastic tales like 'North by Northwest'. That doesn't happen here. There is no explanation at hand, not even a hint for us to go by. Even horrors like George Romero's zombies or crap like 'The Mist' leave a hint for us to work on, to base ourselves. Hitchcock offers nothing at all. He explained that, by giving a reason, the movie would turn into science-fiction; clearly, he must either be an idiot or not understand horror at all. This is a terrible, nonsensical film that should be on par with the likes of 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' or 'Battlefield Earth'. It is as if Ed Wood himself wrote/directed/produced.

    The Birds: I've always been aware of the existence of The Birds and the reputation it held amongst Hitchcock fans. I was not ready for how fantastic it actually is. I was terrified during the film, absolutely frightened by the mere sight of a bird. The build-up is what makes every moment as scary as its reputation says it is. You have the empty feeling that grows in your stomach when you know something is going to happen, and then when the birds would finally take action, I literally shuttered and flinched. I felt like the birds attacking me as I was watching it, I could feel them digging into my skin because the atmosphere is created so well. Hitchcock once said it was the most terrifying movie he's ever made, he was correct. The special effects of the birds are something quite remarkable for its time, unbelievably believable. The Birds takes it time to develop the storyline, but I never lost interest. The script fully realizes and understands its characters, just as good, if not better than any other Hitchcock picture. Tippi Hedren is phenomenal as the lead in the film. My favorite Hitchcock lady. She's not the typical heroine, she has rough, unpolished edges to her, but she makes the movie all the more engaging. I loved every second of The Birds, though the one compliant I have is that it feels a manipulative many times using children as the targets of the birds. I thought Hedren's scenes were better. It doesn't detract much from a excellent horror movie. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A+

    This was the first Hitchcock movie I saw, and up until the last 15 minutes of it I thought it was a good movie. When you see it in the the 21st Century you have to think though out the movie that it was made in the '60s and that's why not everything is quite the way one would have wanted it.. The acting was mostly good and most part of the scenes had great camera angles and light etcetera. The only bad thing about the movie was, like stated above, the last 15 minutes of the film. Why did she go in to the room, instead of just peeking in? Why did she not put up more of a fight with the birds? Why did the birds to this? And why so many different birds? And what happened after they drove off? I H.A.T.E. having questions instead of answers at the end of a movie.

    I've never seen it before and was expecting it to be amazing and scary. My favorite movie is Rear Window, so I know I like his movies, but this was ridiculous and not at all scary. The beginning was exhausting and too much setup. The acting was melodramatic and we literally laughed at times. The writing was horrible and forced. The worst was probably when, near the end of the movie, Melanie (Tippi Hedron) was sitting on the couch curling up into a ball because they here the birds trying to get into the house. Just seemed like either bad acting or bad direction by Hitchcock. I'm gonna guess bad direction because Tippi was a fairly good actress through most of the movie. Oh and the scene where she is attacked in the room! Why would you go in there and then when you're in there getting attacked, why wouldn't you scream? Ugh! Sorry the whole movie annoyed me! Don't waste your time.

    I was looking for a movie to watch and this one caught my eye because of Alfred Hitchcock. It's a long movie, about 2 hours and it really takes you for a wonderful ride. I wasn't bored at any part. The movie starts off as a sort of quirky romantic comedy, perfectly played by Tippi Hedren. Nobody else could have done a better job and that's why I scoff at any remake of this movie. Every scene was perfectly done and you'll probably spend a lot of time smiling (especially at the beginning). Part way through the movie turns into a drama, which I usually don't like - but I love this film in every way. Finally the movie turns into a heart pounding thriller as the birds begin to cause havoc on the beautiful town of Bodega Bay (which is a real place by the way). I won't spoil the ending for you, but if you love movies, this will become one of your favorites.

    Just got done with The Birds movie by Alfred Hitchcock. Had heard about it so finally got my hands on. Its filled with absurd logic of Birds attacking humans for no reason which is so chaotic when you are in the middle of the movie. As the story progressed it had vivid touch of thrill and how nature as in mother nature termed as god can take decisions on its hands when it disapproves of a decision of a human. But why affect the whole Bodega Bay. A very different concept which opens up mind to possibilities which are still yet to be interpreted. I still feel this movie had more to offer but it was stopped at the right time before the concept went off hand. But nevertheless class scenes and cutting edge direction by the great master of suspense.

    As Mark Twain once said, classic is something everyone wants to have read without having to read it, referring to books. The quote is very suitable nowadays for films, especially those regarded as classics. Classic films are usually praised and hailed as masterpieces especially by those who have never seen them. I do not know weather that is the case with Alfred Joseph Hitchcock's ''The Birds'', but ''The Birds'', despite its suspenseful moments, collapses under its weak foundations. ''The Birds'' is not a flawless film. In fact, it fails on many levels, particularly on the acting, the screenplay and the directing. To begin with, the acting in the film is atrocious, mainly from its main cast. Tippi Herden's acting is absolutely horrendous, as she apparently doesn't know how to react to any situation. When something bad happens she reacts scared and when something good happens she reacts happily as if nothing has happened a few minutes ago. She tries to give a sympathetic and somewhat comical performance to portray her good old fashioned nice and naive character but fails completely and instead gives a very annoying performance. With Hedren, you can always see she is acting rather than portraying realistically: her lines are very well rehearsed and she tries to add a little sauce to her performance by talking fast or moving her head in a strange manner, all of which betray her in the end. When the birds attack she looks horrified but afterwards, during her brief conversations with Rod Taylor, she acts as if nothing has happened, talking in a very calm and ordinary way. At the end, all she succeeds is delivering a completely unrealistic and dull performance. Rod Taylor is no better, as is Veronica Cartwright, who portrays his sister. Now, some child actors can be horrendous while others can be amazing. Cartwright's acting belongs in the first category. Jessica Tandy is the only exception in the film's cast who gives a decent performance, overshadowing her co-stars in every scene. Tandy, actually, is the only character who is believable in the film, confirming us that's its a horror film rather than a comedy. The technical parts of the film are good, especially the visual effects by Iwerks and the rapid editing. As for Mr. Hitchcock, apparently he hasn't decided where the film takes place as half of the characters are British (speaking in British accent too) while the others are American. And I don't think they speak British in California. Finally, the ending needed a little work, as by the end of the film one realizes that all the action (thus the entire film) has been pointless, meaning that there is no final redemption. Overall, the film fails to be scary, suspenseful or philosophical (if that's what it wanted to be) and succeeds in being ludicrous.

    Many have pointed out what they see as shortcomings of this film. No explanations for the avian assaults, an ambiguous ending, heck it doesn't even have a soundtrack. But these omissions are its unique strengths. The total lack of explanation leaves you uneasy. The non-ending leaves a disturbing and uneasy situation unresolved. The missing soundtrack leaves you with pure, unadulterated atmosphere. In fact, in adapting Du Maurier's short story, Hitchcock deliberately stripped-out the elements that made sense of it. Possibly, the only borrowed element is the pacing, which follows the slow, brooding menace punctuated with action and terror of John Huston's Moby Dick. Even the most formulaic and conventional scene - the siege on the Tides restaurant, is staged uniquely and brilliantly. In a sense, The Birds is a highly experimental, avant-garde anti-movie, and to that end it succeeds brilliantly. Everyone whose seen it, remembers it vividly, hauntingly.

    . . . can be found right here in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 opus, THE BIRDS. In fact, if you put THE BIRDS side-by-side with ALL of the movies based on King's writings to date, it's hard to believe that there is another classic out there that has so many hallmarks of what today is known as the Stephen King story style. Essentially, THE BIRDS invented Stephen King. Nature run amok. Can you say Cujo? The holy roller tourist mother in the diner going berserk, and blaming visitor Melanie for the rampaging gulls (a delicious irony on Hitchcock's part, since the traveling mom is an outsider herself! The sanctimonious people come up as weak links again and again in King-based works). The Rube Goldberg machine-type scenario leading to one kind of disaster morphing into an even worse apocalyptic horse of a different color, with the exploding gas station and cars. Haven't we seen the exact same thing happen in countless King tales? The quirky egghead (an ornithologist spinster here) and the drunken "doomsayer"--both in the crab shack scenes--get kidnapped to the East Coast in nearly every King screenplay. If you want to see the earliest Stephen King movie, watch THE BIRDS.

    I may be in the minority, but I feel that "The Birds" was Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. The basic premise of the movie is as compelling as any can be; the feathered creatures in the trees and in the sky, which we all take for granted, suddenly begin acting strangely, attacking humans. Tippi Hedren is incomparably lovely as the heroine. One can understand why the sexually frustrated Hitchcock was so obsessed with her. But she's not mere candy for the eyes; Hedren turns in a compelling, underrated performance. Rod Taylor is fine, but is overshadowed by the stunning Hedren, who steals every scene she's in. One of the most memorable, visually impactful scenes in the history of cinema occurs in "The Birds," when Tippi Hedren sits down on a bench at the school playground to smoke a cigarette, and a huge number of birds, with eerie silence, gradually gather on the monkey bars behind her. Another classic moment comes in the diner, where the patrons express the growing panic of the sleepy little community, and an elderly woman, who is an ornithologist, defends the birds, and regarding any war with them, declares, "Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance!" There is a bit too much gore in the film for my taste, and the ending has always struck me as unsatisfying, but overall "The Birds" is a brilliant piece of work, by one of the all time greatest directors.

    A rich woman goes to a small coast town after a man she saw on a pet shop. Her arrival, however, coincides with strange happenings in the city as the birds gradually start attacking everyone. I was attracted by it because of its status as a 'classical horror', appearing in many listings as one of the best horror films, and the fact it's made by Alfred Hitchcock. I can't understand all the hype. Ed Wood made better films. This film is so bad, most of the 'scary' scenes actually had me laughing. No just the 'that is too silly' laugh, but the 'I almost fell out of my chair laughing' laugh; nothing short of Monty Python or Chaplin have ever made me laugh this much. I showed this film to some of my family; the adults were mostly shaking their heads and questioning how Hitchcock could have success with something like this, while the younger ones (10-14 years old) were laughing and later said it was the best comedy they ever watched. The acting is beyond amateurish, with characters mostly making faces to the camera and shrieking to convey their shock being something straight out of a bad parody. It also shocks me that Hitchcock, who always cast beautiful women like Ingrid Bergman, Vera Miles or Grace Kelly to star in his films, would cast the rather ugly Tippi Hedren. Was there no beautiful/cute blondes available? The characters are not far behind with their terrible development, being pretty much caricatures of human beings; Hedren's character being the worst offender, with her motivations or actions. They also act inexplicably dumb at times: Hedren's reaction to the birds in the school being the best example, but also the information given by the radio news. The special effects are terrible. Not just the usual background scenes, but the birds and their attacks are laughably badly done. Suspension of disbelief can only work so far; in here, the birds looked like bad puppets with the way they moved. I fell laughing at most 'attack' scenes, with the gas station one being my favorite. The fact this was Oscar-nominated is nothing short of a joke, you could find better effects in the silent era four decades before this. But the very worst of all is the story itself. Hitchcock always managed to make his stories have a degree of sense, even his most fantastic tales like 'North by Northwest'. That doesn't happen here. There is no explanation at hand, not even a hint for us to go by. Even horrors like George Romero's zombies or crap like 'The Mist' leave a hint for us to work on, to base ourselves. Hitchcock offers nothing at all. He explained that, by giving a reason, the movie would turn into science-fiction; clearly, he must either be an idiot or not understand horror at all. This is a terrible, nonsensical film that should be on par with the likes of 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' or 'Battlefield Earth'. It is as if Ed Wood himself wrote/directed/produced.

    A rich woman goes to a small coast town after a man she saw on a pet shop. Her arrival, however, coincides with strange happenings in the city as the birds gradually start attacking everyone. I was attracted by it because of its status as a 'classical horror', appearing in many listings as one of the best horror films, and the fact it's made by Alfred Hitchcock. I can't understand all the hype. Ed Wood made better films. This film is so bad, most of the 'scary' scenes actually had me laughing. No just the 'that is too silly' laugh, but the 'I almost fell out of my chair laughing' laugh; nothing short of Monty Python or Chaplin have ever made me laugh this much. I showed this film to some of my family; the adults were mostly shaking their heads and questioning how Hitchcock could have success with something like this, while the younger ones (10-14 years old) were laughing and later said it was the best comedy they ever watched. The acting is beyond amateurish, with characters mostly making faces to the camera and shrieking to convey their shock being something straight out of a bad parody. It also shocks me that Hitchcock, who always cast beautiful women like Ingrid Bergman, Vera Miles or Grace Kelly to star in his films, would cast the rather ugly Tippi Hedren. Was there no beautiful/cute blondes available? The characters are not far behind with their terrible development, being pretty much caricatures of human beings; Hedren's character being the worst offender, with her motivations or actions. They also act inexplicably dumb at times: Hedren's reaction to the birds in the school being the best example, but also the information given by the radio news. The special effects are terrible. Not just the usual background scenes, but the birds and their attacks are laughably badly done. Suspension of disbelief can only work so far; in here, the birds looked like bad puppets with the way they moved. I fell laughing at most 'attack' scenes, with the gas station one being my favorite. The fact this was Oscar-nominated is nothing short of a joke, you could find better effects in the silent era four decades before this. But the very worst of all is the story itself. Hitchcock always managed to make his stories have a degree of sense, even his most fantastic tales like 'North by Northwest'. That doesn't happen here. There is no explanation at hand, not even a hint for us to go by. Even horrors like George Romero's zombies or crap like 'The Mist' leave a hint for us to work on, to base ourselves. Hitchcock offers nothing at all. He explained that, by giving a reason, the movie would turn into science-fiction; clearly, he must either be an idiot or not understand horror at all. This is a terrible, nonsensical film that should be on par with the likes of 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' or 'Battlefield Earth'. It is as if Ed Wood himself wrote/directed/produced.

    The Birds: I've always been aware of the existence of The Birds and the reputation it held amongst Hitchcock fans. I was not ready for how fantastic it actually is. I was terrified during the film, absolutely frightened by the mere sight of a bird. The build-up is what makes every moment as scary as its reputation says it is. You have the empty feeling that grows in your stomach when you know something is going to happen, and then when the birds would finally take action, I literally shuttered and flinched. I felt like the birds attacking me as I was watching it, I could feel them digging into my skin because the atmosphere is created so well. Hitchcock once said it was the most terrifying movie he's ever made, he was correct. The special effects of the birds are something quite remarkable for its time, unbelievably believable. The Birds takes it time to develop the storyline, but I never lost interest. The script fully realizes and understands its characters, just as good, if not better than any other Hitchcock picture. Tippi Hedren is phenomenal as the lead in the film. My favorite Hitchcock lady. She's not the typical heroine, she has rough, unpolished edges to her, but she makes the movie all the more engaging. I loved every second of The Birds, though the one compliant I have is that it feels a manipulative many times using children as the targets of the birds. I thought Hedren's scenes were better. It doesn't detract much from a excellent horror movie. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A+

    This was the first Hitchcock movie I saw, and up until the last 15 minutes of it I thought it was a good movie. When you see it in the the 21st Century you have to think though out the movie that it was made in the '60s and that's why not everything is quite the way one would have wanted it.. The acting was mostly good and most part of the scenes had great camera angles and light etcetera. The only bad thing about the movie was, like stated above, the last 15 minutes of the film. Why did she go in to the room, instead of just peeking in? Why did she not put up more of a fight with the birds? Why did the birds to this? And why so many different birds? And what happened after they drove off? I H.A.T.E. having questions instead of answers at the end of a movie.

    I've never seen it before and was expecting it to be amazing and scary. My favorite movie is Rear Window, so I know I like his movies, but this was ridiculous and not at all scary. The beginning was exhausting and too much setup. The acting was melodramatic and we literally laughed at times. The writing was horrible and forced. The worst was probably when, near the end of the movie, Melanie (Tippi Hedron) was sitting on the couch curling up into a ball because they here the birds trying to get into the house. Just seemed like either bad acting or bad direction by Hitchcock. I'm gonna guess bad direction because Tippi was a fairly good actress through most of the movie. Oh and the scene where she is attacked in the room! Why would you go in there and then when you're in there getting attacked, why wouldn't you scream? Ugh! Sorry the whole movie annoyed me! Don't waste your time.

    I was looking for a movie to watch and this one caught my eye because of Alfred Hitchcock. It's a long movie, about 2 hours and it really takes you for a wonderful ride. I wasn't bored at any part. The movie starts off as a sort of quirky romantic comedy, perfectly played by Tippi Hedren. Nobody else could have done a better job and that's why I scoff at any remake of this movie. Every scene was perfectly done and you'll probably spend a lot of time smiling (especially at the beginning). Part way through the movie turns into a drama, which I usually don't like - but I love this film in every way. Finally the movie turns into a heart pounding thriller as the birds begin to cause havoc on the beautiful town of Bodega Bay (which is a real place by the way). I won't spoil the ending for you, but if you love movies, this will become one of your favorites.

    Just got done with The Birds movie by Alfred Hitchcock. Had heard about it so finally got my hands on. Its filled with absurd logic of Birds attacking humans for no reason which is so chaotic when you are in the middle of the movie. As the story progressed it had vivid touch of thrill and how nature as in mother nature termed as god can take decisions on its hands when it disapproves of a decision of a human. But why affect the whole Bodega Bay. A very different concept which opens up mind to possibilities which are still yet to be interpreted. I still feel this movie had more to offer but it was stopped at the right time before the concept went off hand. But nevertheless class scenes and cutting edge direction by the great master of suspense.

    As Mark Twain once said, classic is something everyone wants to have read without having to read it, referring to books. The quote is very suitable nowadays for films, especially those regarded as classics. Classic films are usually praised and hailed as masterpieces especially by those who have never seen them. I do not know weather that is the case with Alfred Joseph Hitchcock's ''The Birds'', but ''The Birds'', despite its suspenseful moments, collapses under its weak foundations. ''The Birds'' is not a flawless film. In fact, it fails on many levels, particularly on the acting, the screenplay and the directing. To begin with, the acting in the film is atrocious, mainly from its main cast. Tippi Herden's acting is absolutely horrendous, as she apparently doesn't know how to react to any situation. When something bad happens she reacts scared and when something good happens she reacts happily as if nothing has happened a few minutes ago. She tries to give a sympathetic and somewhat comical performance to portray her good old fashioned nice and naive character but fails completely and instead gives a very annoying performance. With Hedren, you can always see she is acting rather than portraying realistically: her lines are very well rehearsed and she tries to add a little sauce to her performance by talking fast or moving her head in a strange manner, all of which betray her in the end. When the birds attack she looks horrified but afterwards, during her brief conversations with Rod Taylor, she acts as if nothing has happened, talking in a very calm and ordinary way. At the end, all she succeeds is delivering a completely unrealistic and dull performance. Rod Taylor is no better, as is Veronica Cartwright, who portrays his sister. Now, some child actors can be horrendous while others can be amazing. Cartwright's acting belongs in the first category. Jessica Tandy is the only exception in the film's cast who gives a decent performance, overshadowing her co-stars in every scene. Tandy, actually, is the only character who is believable in the film, confirming us that's its a horror film rather than a comedy. The technical parts of the film are good, especially the visual effects by Iwerks and the rapid editing. As for Mr. Hitchcock, apparently he hasn't decided where the film takes place as half of the characters are British (speaking in British accent too) while the others are American. And I don't think they speak British in California. Finally, the ending needed a little work, as by the end of the film one realizes that all the action (thus the entire film) has been pointless, meaning that there is no final redemption. Overall, the film fails to be scary, suspenseful or philosophical (if that's what it wanted to be) and succeeds in being ludicrous.

    Many have pointed out what they see as shortcomings of this film. No explanations for the avian assaults, an ambiguous ending, heck it doesn't even have a soundtrack. But these omissions are its unique strengths. The total lack of explanation leaves you uneasy. The non-ending leaves a disturbing and uneasy situation unresolved. The missing soundtrack leaves you with pure, unadulterated atmosphere. In fact, in adapting Du Maurier's short story, Hitchcock deliberately stripped-out the elements that made sense of it. Possibly, the only borrowed element is the pacing, which follows the slow, brooding menace punctuated with action and terror of John Huston's Moby Dick. Even the most formulaic and conventional scene - the siege on the Tides restaurant, is staged uniquely and brilliantly. In a sense, The Birds is a highly experimental, avant-garde anti-movie, and to that end it succeeds brilliantly. Everyone whose seen it, remembers it vividly, hauntingly. Lets hope nobody ever tries a remake.

    . . . can be found right here in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 opus, THE BIRDS. In fact, if you put THE BIRDS side-by-side with ALL of the movies based on King's writings to date, it's hard to believe that there is another classic out there that has so many hallmarks of what today is known as the Stephen King story style. Essentially, THE BIRDS invented Stephen King. Nature run amok. Can you say Cujo? The holy roller tourist mother in the diner going berserk, and blaming visitor Melanie for the rampaging gulls (a delicious irony on Hitchcock's part, since the traveling mom is an outsider herself! The sanctimonious people come up as weak links again and again in King-based works). The Rube Goldberg machine-type scenario leading to one kind of disaster morphing into an even worse apocalyptic horse of a different color, with the exploding gas station and cars. Haven't we seen the exact same thing happen in countless King tales? The quirky egghead (an ornithologist spinster here) and the drunken "doomsayer"--both in the crab shack scenes--get kidnapped to the East Coast in nearly every King screenplay. If you want to see the earliest Stephen King movie, watch THE BIRDS.

    I may be in the minority, but I feel that "The Birds" was Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. The basic premise of the movie is as compelling as any can be; the feathered creatures in the trees and in the sky, which we all take for granted, suddenly begin acting strangely, attacking humans. Tippi Hedren is incomparably lovely as the heroine. One can understand why the sexually frustrated Hitchcock was so obsessed with her. But she's not mere candy for the eyes; Hedren turns in a compelling, underrated performance. Rod Taylor is fine, but is overshadowed by the stunning Hedren, who steals every scene she's in. One of the most memorable, visually impactful scenes in the history of cinema occurs in "The Birds," when Tippi Hedren sits down on a bench at the school playground to smoke a cigarette, and a huge number of birds, with eerie silence, gradually gather on the monkey bars behind her. Another classic moment comes in the diner, where the patrons express the growing panic of the sleepy little community, and an elderly woman, who is an ornithologist, defends the birds, and regarding any war with them, declares, "Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance!" There is a bit too much gore in the film for my taste, and the ending has always struck me as unsatisfying, but overall "The Birds" is a brilliant piece of work, by one of the all time greatest directors.

    I may be in the minority, but I feel that "The Birds" was Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. The basic premise of the movie is as compelling as any can be; the feathered creatures in the trees and in the sky, which we all take for granted, suddenly begin acting strangely, attacking humans. Tippi Hedren is incomparably lovely as the heroine. One can understand why the sexually frustrated Hitchcock was so obsessed with her. But she's not mere candy for the eyes; Hedren turns in a compelling, underrated performance. Rod Taylor is fine, but is overshadowed by the stunning Hedren, who steals every scene she's in. One of the most memorable, visually impactful scenes in the history of cinema occurs in "The Birds," when Tippi Hedren sits down on a bench at the school playground to smoke a cigarette, and a huge number of birds, with eerie silence, gradually gather on the monkey bars behind her. Another classic moment comes in the diner, where the patrons express the growing panic of the sleepy little community, and an elderly woman, who is an ornithologist, defends the birds, and regarding any war with them, declares, "Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance!" There is a bit too much gore in the film for my taste, and the ending has always struck me as unsatisfying, but overall "The Birds" is a brilliant piece of work, by one of the all time greatest directors.

    A rich woman goes to a small coast town after a man she saw on a pet shop. Her arrival, however, coincides with strange happenings in the city as the birds gradually start attacking everyone. I was attracted by it because of its status as a 'classical horror', appearing in many listings as one of the best horror films, and the fact it's made by Alfred Hitchcock. I can't understand all the hype. Ed Wood made better films. This film is so bad, most of the 'scary' scenes actually had me laughing. No just the 'that is too silly' laugh, but the 'I almost fell out of my chair laughing' laugh; nothing short of Monty Python or Chaplin have ever made me laugh this much. I showed this film to some of my family; the adults were mostly shaking their heads and questioning how Hitchcock could have success with something like this, while the younger ones (10-14 years old) were laughing and later said it was the best comedy they ever watched. The acting is beyond amateurish, with characters mostly making faces to the camera and shrieking to convey their shock being something straight out of a bad parody. It also shocks me that Hitchcock, who always cast beautiful women like Ingrid Bergman, Vera Miles or Grace Kelly to star in his films, would cast the rather ugly Tippi Hedren. Was there no beautiful/cute blondes available? The characters are not far behind with their terrible development, being pretty much caricatures of human beings; Hedren's character being the worst offender, with her motivations or actions. They also act inexplicably dumb at times: Hedren's reaction to the birds in the school being the best example, but also the information given by the radio news. The special effects are terrible. Not just the usual background scenes, but the birds and their attacks are laughably badly done. Suspension of disbelief can only work so far; in here, the birds looked like bad puppets with the way they moved. I fell laughing at most 'attack' scenes, with the gas station one being my favorite. The fact this was Oscar-nominated is nothing short of a joke, you could find better effects in the silent era four decades before this. But the very worst of all is the story itself. Hitchcock always managed to make his stories have a degree of sense, even his most fantastic tales like 'North by Northwest'. That doesn't happen here. There is no explanation at hand, not even a hint for us to go by. Even horrors like George Romero's zombies or crap like 'The Mist' leave a hint for us to work on, to base ourselves. Hitchcock offers nothing at all. He explained that, by giving a reason, the movie would turn into science-fiction; clearly, he must either be an idiot or not understand horror at all. This is a terrible, nonsensical film that should be on par with the likes of 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' or 'Battlefield Earth'. It is as if Ed Wood himself wrote/directed/produced.

    The Birds: I've always been aware of the existence of The Birds and the reputation it held amongst Hitchcock fans. I was not ready for how fantastic it actually is. I was terrified during the film, absolutely frightened by the mere sight of a bird. The build-up is what makes every moment as scary as its reputation says it is. You have the empty feeling that grows in your stomach when you know something is going to happen, and then when the birds would finally take action, I literally shuttered and flinched. I felt like the birds attacking me as I was watching it, I could feel them digging into my skin because the atmosphere is created so well. Hitchcock once said it was the most terrifying movie he's ever made, he was correct. The special effects of the birds are something quite remarkable for its time, unbelievably believable. The Birds takes it time to develop the storyline, but I never lost interest. The script fully realizes and understands its characters, just as good, if not better than any other Hitchcock picture. Tippi Hedren is phenomenal as the lead in the film. My favorite Hitchcock lady. She's not the typical heroine, she has rough, unpolished edges to her, but she makes the movie all the more engaging. I loved every second of The Birds, though the one compliant I have is that it feels a manipulative many times using children as the targets of the birds. I thought Hedren's scenes were better. It doesn't detract much from a excellent horror movie. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A+

    This was the first Hitchcock movie I saw, and up until the last 15 minutes of it I thought it was a good movie. When you see it in the the 21st Century you have to think though out the movie that it was made in the '60s and that's why not everything is quite the way one would have wanted it.. The acting was mostly good and most part of the scenes had great camera angles and light etcetera. The only bad thing about the movie was, like stated above, the last 15 minutes of the film. Why did she go in to the room, instead of just peeking in? Why did she not put up more of a fight with the birds? Why did the birds to this? And why so many different birds? And what happened after they drove off? I H.A.T.E. having questions instead of answers at the end of a movie.

    I've never seen it before and was expecting it to be amazing and scary. My favorite movie is Rear Window, so I know I like his movies, but this was ridiculous and not at all scary. The beginning was exhausting and too much setup. The acting was melodramatic and we literally laughed at times. The writing was horrible and forced. The worst was probably when, near the end of the movie, Melanie (Tippi Hedron) was sitting on the couch curling up into a ball because they here the birds trying to get into the house. Just seemed like either bad acting or bad direction by Hitchcock. I'm gonna guess bad direction because Tippi was a fairly good actress through most of the movie. Oh and the scene where she is attacked in the room! Why would you go in there and then when you're in there getting attacked, why wouldn't you scream? Ugh! Sorry the whole movie annoyed me! Don't waste your time.

    I was looking for a movie to watch and this one caught my eye because of Alfred Hitchcock. It's a long movie, about 2 hours and it really takes you for a wonderful ride. I wasn't bored at any part. The movie starts off as a sort of quirky romantic comedy, perfectly played by Tippi Hedren. Nobody else could have done a better job and that's why I scoff at any remake of this movie. Every scene was perfectly done and you'll probably spend a lot of time smiling (especially at the beginning). Part way through the movie turns into a drama, which I usually don't like - but I love this film in every way. Finally the movie turns into a heart pounding thriller as the birds begin to cause havoc on the beautiful town of Bodega Bay (which is a real place by the way). I won't spoil the ending for you, but if you love movies, this will become one of your favorites.

    Just got done with The Birds movie by Alfred Hitchcock. Had heard about it so finally got my hands on. Its filled with absurd logic of Birds attacking humans for no reason which is so chaotic when you are in the middle of the movie. As the story progressed it had vivid touch of thrill and how nature as in mother nature termed as god can take decisions on its hands when it disapproves of a decision of a human. But why affect the whole Bodega Bay. A very different concept which opens up mind to possibilities which are still yet to be interpreted. I still feel this movie had more to offer but it was stopped at the right time before the concept went off hand. But nevertheless class scenes and cutting edge direction by the great master of suspense.

    As Mark Twain once said, classic is something everyone wants to have read without having to read it, referring to books. The quote is very suitable nowadays for films, especially those regarded as classics. Classic films are usually praised and hailed as masterpieces especially by those who have never seen them. I do not know weather that is the case with Alfred Joseph Hitchcock's ''The Birds'', but ''The Birds'', despite its suspenseful moments, collapses under its weak foundations. ''The Birds'' is not a flawless film. In fact, it fails on many levels, particularly on the acting, the screenplay and the directing. To begin with, the acting in the film is atrocious, mainly from its main cast. Tippi Herden's acting is absolutely horrendous, as she apparently doesn't know how to react to any situation. When something bad happens she reacts scared and when something good happens she reacts happily as if nothing has happened a few minutes ago. She tries to give a sympathetic and somewhat comical performance to portray her good old fashioned nice and naive character but fails completely and instead gives a very annoying performance. With Hedren, you can always see she is acting rather than portraying realistically: her lines are very well rehearsed and she tries to add a little sauce to her performance by talking fast or moving her head in a strange manner, all of which betray her in the end. When the birds attack she looks horrified but afterwards, during her brief conversations with Rod Taylor, she acts as if nothing has happened, talking in a very calm and ordinary way. At the end, all she succeeds is delivering a completely unrealistic and dull performance. Rod Taylor is no better, as is Veronica Cartwright, who portrays his sister. Now, some child actors can be horrendous while others can be amazing. Cartwright's acting belongs in the first category. Jessica Tandy is the only exception in the film's cast who gives a decent performance, overshadowing her co-stars in every scene. Tandy, actually, is the only character who is believable in the film, confirming us that's its a horror film rather than a comedy. The technical parts of the film are good, especially the visual effects by Iwerks and the rapid editing. As for Mr. Hitchcock, apparently he hasn't decided where the film takes place as half of the characters are British (speaking in British accent too) while the others are American. And I don't think they speak British in California. Finally, the ending needed a little work, as by the end of the film one realizes that all the action (thus the entire film) has been pointless, meaning that there is no final redemption. Overall, the film fails to be scary, suspenseful or philosophical (if that's what it wanted to be) and succeeds in being ludicrous.

    Many have pointed out what they see as shortcomings of this film. No explanations for the avian assaults, an ambiguous ending, heck it doesn't even have a soundtrack. But these omissions are its unique strengths. The total lack of explanation leaves you uneasy. The non-ending leaves a disturbing and uneasy situation unresolved. The missing soundtrack leaves you with pure, unadulterated atmosphere. In fact, in adapting Du Maurier's short story, Hitchcock deliberately stripped-out the elements that made sense of it. Possibly, the only borrowed element is the pacing, which follows the slow, brooding menace punctuated with action and terror of John Huston's Moby Dick. Even the most formulaic and conventional scene - the siege on the Tides restaurant, is staged uniquely and brilliantly. In a sense, The Birds is a highly experimental, avant-garde anti-movie, and to that end it succeeds brilliantly. Everyone whose seen it, remembers it vividly, hauntingly. Lets hope nobody ever tries a remake.

    . . . can be found right here in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 opus, THE BIRDS. In fact, if you put THE BIRDS side-by-side with ALL of the movies based on King's writings to date, it's hard to believe that there is another classic out there that has so many hallmarks of what today is known as the Stephen King story style. Essentially, THE BIRDS invented Stephen King. Nature run amok. Can you say Cujo? The holy roller tourist mother in the diner going berserk, and blaming visitor Melanie for the rampaging gulls (a delicious irony on Hitchcock's part, since the traveling mom is an outsider herself! The sanctimonious people come up as weak links again and again in King-based works). The Rube Goldberg machine-type scenario leading to one kind of disaster morphing into an even worse apocalyptic horse of a different color, with the exploding gas station and cars. Haven't we seen the exact same thing happen in countless King tales? The quirky egghead (an ornithologist spinster here) and the drunken "doomsayer"--both in the crab shack scenes--get kidnapped to the East Coast in nearly every King screenplay. If you want to see the earliest Stephen King movie, watch THE BIRDS.

    . . . can be found right here in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 opus, THE BIRDS. In fact, if you put THE BIRDS side-by-side with ALL of the movies based on King's writings to date, it's hard to believe that there is another classic out there that has so many hallmarks of what today is known as the Stephen King story style. Essentially, THE BIRDS invented Stephen King. Nature run amok. Can you say Cujo? The holy roller tourist mother in the diner going berserk, and blaming visitor Melanie for the rampaging gulls (a delicious irony on Hitchcock's part, since the traveling mom is an outsider herself! The sanctimonious people come up as weak links again and again in King-based works). The Rube Goldberg machine-type scenario leading to one kind of disaster morphing into an even worse apocalyptic horse of a different color, with the exploding gas station and cars. Haven't we seen the exact same thing happen in countless King tales? The quirky egghead (an ornithologist spinster here) and the drunken "doomsayer"--both in the crab shack scenes--get kidnapped to the East Coast in nearly every King screenplay. If you want to see the earliest Stephen King movie, watch THE BIRDS.

    I may be in the minority, but I feel that "The Birds" was Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. The basic premise of the movie is as compelling as any can be; the feathered creatures in the trees and in the sky, which we all take for granted, suddenly begin acting strangely, attacking humans. Tippi Hedren is incomparably lovely as the heroine. One can understand why the sexually frustrated Hitchcock was so obsessed with her. But she's not mere candy for the eyes; Hedren turns in a compelling, underrated performance. Rod Taylor is fine, but is overshadowed by the stunning Hedren, who steals every scene she's in. One of the most memorable, visually impactful scenes in the history of cinema occurs in "The Birds," when Tippi Hedren sits down on a bench at the school playground to smoke a cigarette, and a huge number of birds, with eerie silence, gradually gather on the monkey bars behind her. Another classic moment comes in the diner, where the patrons express the growing panic of the sleepy little community, and an elderly woman, who is an ornithologist, defends the birds, and regarding any war with them, declares, "Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance!" There is a bit too much gore in the film for my taste, and the ending has always struck me as unsatisfying, but overall "The Birds" is a brilliant piece of work, by one of the all time greatest directors.

    A rich woman goes to a small coast town after a man she saw on a pet shop. Her arrival, however, coincides with strange happenings in the city as the birds gradually start attacking everyone. I was attracted by it because of its status as a 'classical horror', appearing in many listings as one of the best horror films, and the fact it's made by Alfred Hitchcock. I can't understand all the hype. Ed Wood made better films. This film is so bad, most of the 'scary' scenes actually had me laughing. No just the 'that is too silly' laugh, but the 'I almost fell out of my chair laughing' laugh; nothing short of Monty Python or Chaplin have ever made me laugh this much. I showed this film to some of my family; the adults were mostly shaking their heads and questioning how Hitchcock could have success with something like this, while the younger ones (10-14 years old) were laughing and later said it was the best comedy they ever watched. The acting is beyond amateurish, with characters mostly making faces to the camera and shrieking to convey their shock being something straight out of a bad parody. It also shocks me that Hitchcock, who always cast beautiful women like Ingrid Bergman, Vera Miles or Grace Kelly to star in his films, would cast the rather ugly Tippi Hedren. Was there no beautiful/cute blondes available? The characters are not far behind with their terrible development, being pretty much caricatures of human beings; Hedren's character being the worst offender, with her motivations or actions. They also act inexplicably dumb at times: Hedren's reaction to the birds in the school being the best example, but also the information given by the radio news. The special effects are terrible. Not just the usual background scenes, but the birds and their attacks are laughably badly done. Suspension of disbelief can only work so far; in here, the birds looked like bad puppets with the way they moved. I fell laughing at most 'attack' scenes, with the gas station one being my favorite. The fact this was Oscar-nominated is nothing short of a joke, you could find better effects in the silent era four decades before this. But the very worst of all is the story itself. Hitchcock always managed to make his stories have a degree of sense, even his most fantastic tales like 'North by Northwest'. That doesn't happen here. There is no explanation at hand, not even a hint for us to go by. Even horrors like George Romero's zombies or crap like 'The Mist' leave a hint for us to work on, to base ourselves. Hitchcock offers nothing at all. He explained that, by giving a reason, the movie would turn into science-fiction; clearly, he must either be an idiot or not understand horror at all. This is a terrible, nonsensical film that should be on par with the likes of 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' or 'Battlefield Earth'. It is as if Ed Wood himself wrote/directed/produced.

    The Birds: I've always been aware of the existence of The Birds and the reputation it held amongst Hitchcock fans. I was not ready for how fantastic it actually is. I was terrified during the film, absolutely frightened by the mere sight of a bird. The build-up is what makes every moment as scary as its reputation says it is. You have the empty feeling that grows in your stomach when you know something is going to happen, and then when the birds would finally take action, I literally shuttered and flinched. I felt like the birds attacking me as I was watching it, I could feel them digging into my skin because the atmosphere is created so well. Hitchcock once said it was the most terrifying movie he's ever made, he was correct. The special effects of the birds are something quite remarkable for its time, unbelievably believable. The Birds takes it time to develop the storyline, but I never lost interest. The script fully realizes and understands its characters, just as good, if not better than any other Hitchcock picture. Tippi Hedren is phenomenal as the lead in the film. My favorite Hitchcock lady. She's not the typical heroine, she has rough, unpolished edges to her, but she makes the movie all the more engaging. I loved every second of The Birds, though the one compliant I have is that it feels a manipulative many times using children as the targets of the birds. I thought Hedren's scenes were better. It doesn't detract much from a excellent horror movie. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A+

    This was the first Hitchcock movie I saw, and up until the last 15 minutes of it I thought it was a good movie. When you see it in the the 21st Century you have to think though out the movie that it was made in the '60s and that's why not everything is quite the way one would have wanted it.. The acting was mostly good and most part of the scenes had great camera angles and light etcetera. The only bad thing about the movie was, like stated above, the last 15 minutes of the film. Why did she go in to the room, instead of just peeking in? Why did she not put up more of a fight with the birds? Why did the birds to this? And why so many different birds? And what happened after they drove off? I H.A.T.E. having questions instead of answers at the end of a movie.

    I've never seen it before and was expecting it to be amazing and scary. My favorite movie is Rear Window, so I know I like his movies, but this was ridiculous and not at all scary. The beginning was exhausting and too much setup. The acting was melodramatic and we literally laughed at times. The writing was horrible and forced. The worst was probably when, near the end of the movie, Melanie (Tippi Hedron) was sitting on the couch curling up into a ball because they here the birds trying to get into the house. Just seemed like either bad acting or bad direction by Hitchcock. I'm gonna guess bad direction because Tippi was a fairly good actress through most of the movie. Oh and the scene where she is attacked in the room! Why would you go in there and then when you're in there getting attacked, why wouldn't you scream? Ugh! Sorry the whole movie annoyed me! Don't waste your time.

    I was looking for a movie to watch and this one caught my eye because of Alfred Hitchcock. It's a long movie, about 2 hours and it really takes you for a wonderful ride. I wasn't bored at any part. The movie starts off as a sort of quirky romantic comedy, perfectly played by Tippi Hedren. Nobody else could have done a better job and that's why I scoff at any remake of this movie. Every scene was perfectly done and you'll probably spend a lot of time smiling (especially at the beginning). Part way through the movie turns into a drama, which I usually don't like - but I love this film in every way. Finally the movie turns into a heart pounding thriller as the birds begin to cause havoc on the beautiful town of Bodega Bay (which is a real place by the way). I won't spoil the ending for you, but if you love movies, this will become one of your favorites.

    Just got done with The Birds movie by Alfred Hitchcock. Had heard about it so finally got my hands on. Its filled with absurd logic of Birds attacking humans for no reason which is so chaotic when you are in the middle of the movie. As the story progressed it had vivid touch of thrill and how nature as in mother nature termed as god can take decisions on its hands when it disapproves of a decision of a human. But why affect the whole Bodega Bay. A very different concept which opens up mind to possibilities which are still yet to be interpreted. I still feel this movie had more to offer but it was stopped at the right time before the concept went off hand. But nevertheless class scenes and cutting edge direction by the great master of suspense.

    As Mark Twain once said, classic is something everyone wants to have read without having to read it, referring to books. The quote is very suitable nowadays for films, especially those regarded as classics. Classic films are usually praised and hailed as masterpieces especially by those who have never seen them. I do not know weather that is the case with Alfred Joseph Hitchcock's ''The Birds'', but ''The Birds'', despite its suspenseful moments, collapses under its weak foundations. ''The Birds'' is not a flawless film. In fact, it fails on many levels, particularly on the acting, the screenplay and the directing. To begin with, the acting in the film is atrocious, mainly from its main cast. Tippi Herden's acting is absolutely horrendous, as she apparently doesn't know how to react to any situation. When something bad happens she reacts scared and when something good happens she reacts happily as if nothing has happened a few minutes ago. She tries to give a sympathetic and somewhat comical performance to portray her good old fashioned nice and naive character but fails completely and instead gives a very annoying performance. With Hedren, you can always see she is acting rather than portraying realistically: her lines are very well rehearsed and she tries to add a little sauce to her performance by talking fast or moving her head in a strange manner, all of which betray her in the end. When the birds attack she looks horrified but afterwards, during her brief conversations with Rod Taylor, she acts as if nothing has happened, talking in a very calm and ordinary way. At the end, all she succeeds is delivering a completely unrealistic and dull performance. Rod Taylor is no better, as is Veronica Cartwright, who portrays his sister. Now, some child actors can be horrendous while others can be amazing. Cartwright's acting belongs in the first category. Jessica Tandy is the only exception in the film's cast who gives a decent performance, overshadowing her co-stars in every scene. Tandy, actually, is the only character who is believable in the film, confirming us that's its a horror film rather than a comedy. The technical parts of the film are good, especially the visual effects by Iwerks and the rapid editing. As for Mr. Hitchcock, apparently he hasn't decided where the film takes place as half of the characters are British (speaking in British accent too) while the others are American. And I don't think they speak British in California. Finally, the ending needed a little work, as by the end of the film one realizes that all the action (thus the entire film) has been pointless, meaning that there is no final redemption. Overall, the film fails to be scary, suspenseful or philosophical (if that's what it wanted to be) and succeeds in being ludicrous.

    Many have pointed out what they see as shortcomings of this film. No explanations for the avian assaults, an ambiguous ending, heck it doesn't even have a soundtrack. But these omissions are its unique strengths. The total lack of explanation leaves you uneasy. The non-ending leaves a disturbing and uneasy situation unresolved. The missing soundtrack leaves you with pure, unadulterated atmosphere. In fact, in adapting Du Maurier's short story, Hitchcock deliberately stripped-out the elements that made sense of it. Possibly, the only borrowed element is the pacing, which follows the slow, brooding menace punctuated with action and terror of John Huston's Moby Dick. Even the most formulaic and conventional scene - the siege on the Tides restaurant, is staged uniquely and brilliantly. In a sense, The Birds is a highly experimental, avant-garde anti-movie, and to that end it succeeds brilliantly. Everyone whose seen it, remembers it vividly, hauntingly. Lets hope nobody ever tries a remake.

In fact, if you put THE BIRDS side-by-side with ALL of the movies based on King's writings to date, it's hard to believe that there is another classic out there that has so many hallmarks of what today is known as the Stephen King story style.

The holy roller tourist mother in the diner going berserk, and blaming visitor Melanie for the rampaging gulls (a delicious irony on Hitchcock's part, since the traveling mom is an outsider herself! The sanctimonious people come up as weak links again and again in King-based works). The Rube Goldberg machine-type scenario leading to one kind of disaster morphing into an even worse apocalyptic horse of a different color, with the exploding gas station and cars. Haven't we seen the exact same thing happen in countless King tales? The quirky egghead (an ornithologist spinster here) and the drunken "doomsayer"--both in the crab shack scenes--get kidnapped to the East Coast in nearly every King screenplay.

Finally, the ending needed a little work, as by the end of the film one realizes that all the action (thus the entire film) has been pointless, meaning that there is no final redemption. Overall, the film fails to be scary, suspenseful or philosophical (if that's what it wanted to be) and succeeds in being ludicrous.

    Many have pointed out what they see as shortcomings of this film. No explanations for the avian assaults, an ambiguous ending, heck it doesn't even have a soundtrack. But these omissions are its unique strengths. The total lack of explanation leaves you uneasy. The non-ending leaves a disturbing and uneasy situation unresolved. The missing soundtrack leaves you with pure, unadulterated atmosphere. In fact, in adapting Du Maurier's short story, Hitchcock deliberately stripped-out the elements that made sense of it. Possibly, the only borrowed element is the pacing, which follows the slow, brooding menace punctuated with action and terror of John Huston's Moby Dick. Even the most formulaic and conventional scene - the siege on the Tides restaurant, is staged uniquely and brilliantly. In a sense, The Birds is a highly experimental, avant-garde anti-movie, and to that end it succeeds brilliantly. Everyone whose seen it, remembers it vividly, hauntingly. Lets hope nobody ever tries a remake.

    . . . can be found right here in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 opus, THE BIRDS. In fact, if you put THE BIRDS side-by-side with ALL of the movies based on King's writings to date, it's hard to believe that there is another classic out there that has so many hallmarks of what today is known as the Stephen King story style. Essentially, THE BIRDS invented Stephen King. Nature run amok. Can you say Cujo? The holy roller tourist mother in the diner going berserk, and blaming visitor Melanie for the rampaging gulls (a delicious irony on Hitchcock's part, since the traveling mom is an outsider herself! The sanctimonious people come up as weak links again and again in King-based works). The Rube Goldberg machine-type scenario leading to one kind of disaster morphing into an even worse apocalyptic horse of a different color, with the exploding gas station and cars. Haven't we seen the exact same thing happen in countless King tales? The quirky egghead (an ornithologist spinster here) and the drunken "doomsayer"--both in the crab shack scenes--get kidnapped to the East Coast in nearly every King screenplay. If you want to see the earliest Stephen King movie, watch THE BIRDS.

    I may be in the minority, but I feel that "The Birds" was Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. The basic premise of the movie is as compelling as any can be; the feathered creatures in the trees and in the sky, which we all take for granted, suddenly begin acting strangely, attacking humans. Tippi Hedren is incomparably lovely as the heroine. One can understand why the sexually frustrated Hitchcock was so obsessed with her. But she's not mere candy for the eyes; Hedren turns in a compelling, underrated performance. Rod Taylor is fine, but is overshadowed by the stunning Hedren, who steals every scene she's in. One of the most memorable, visually impactful scenes in the history of cinema occurs in "The Birds," when Tippi Hedren sits down on a bench at the school playground to smoke a cigarette, and a huge number of birds, with eerie silence, gradually gather on the monkey bars behind her. Another classic moment comes in the diner, where the patrons express the growing panic of the sleepy little community, and an elderly woman, who is an ornithologist, defends the birds, and regarding any war with them, declares, "Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance!" There is a bit too much gore in the film for my taste, and the ending has always struck me as unsatisfying, but overall "The Birds" is a brilliant piece of work, by one of the all time greatest directors.

    A rich woman goes to a small coast town after a man she saw on a pet shop. Her arrival, however, coincides with strange happenings in the city as the birds gradually start attacking everyone. I was attracted by it because of its status as a 'classical horror', appearing in many listings as one of the best horror films, and the fact it's made by Alfred Hitchcock. I can't understand all the hype. Ed Wood made better films. This film is so bad, most of the 'scary' scenes actually had me laughing. No just the 'that is too silly' laugh, but the 'I almost fell out of my chair laughing' laugh; nothing short of Monty Python or Chaplin have ever made me laugh this much. I showed this film to some of my family; the adults were mostly shaking their heads and questioning how Hitchcock could have success with something like this, while the younger ones (10-14 years old) were laughing and later said it was the best comedy they ever watched. The acting is beyond amateurish, with characters mostly making faces to the camera and shrieking to convey their shock being something straight out of a bad parody. It also shocks me that Hitchcock, who always cast beautiful women like Ingrid Bergman, Vera Miles or Grace Kelly to star in his films, would cast the rather ugly Tippi Hedren. Was there no beautiful/cute blondes available? The characters are not far behind with their terrible development, being pretty much caricatures of human beings; Hedren's character being the worst offender, with her motivations or actions. They also act inexplicably dumb at times: Hedren's reaction to the birds in the school being the best example, but also the information given by the radio news. The special effects are terrible. Not just the usual background scenes, but the birds and their attacks are laughably badly done. Suspension of disbelief can only work so far; in here, the birds looked like bad puppets with the way they moved. I fell laughing at most 'attack' scenes, with the gas station one being my favorite. The fact this was Oscar-nominated is nothing short of a joke, you could find better effects in the silent era four decades before this. But the very worst of all is the story itself. Hitchcock always managed to make his stories have a degree of sense, even his most fantastic tales like 'North by Northwest'. That doesn't happen here. There is no explanation at hand, not even a hint for us to go by. Even horrors like George Romero's zombies or crap like 'The Mist' leave a hint for us to work on, to base ourselves. Hitchcock offers nothing at all. He explained that, by giving a reason, the movie would turn into science-fiction; clearly, he must either be an idiot or not understand horror at all. This is a terrible, nonsensical film that should be on par with the likes of 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' or 'Battlefield Earth'. It is as if Ed Wood himself wrote/directed/produced.

    The Birds: I've always been aware of the existence of The Birds and the reputation it held amongst Hitchcock fans. I was not ready for how fantastic it actually is. I was terrified during the film, absolutely frightened by the mere sight of a bird. The build-up is what makes every moment as scary as its reputation says it is. You have the empty feeling that grows in your stomach when you know something is going to happen, and then when the birds would finally take action, I literally shuttered and flinched. I felt like the birds attacking me as I was watching it, I could feel them digging into my skin because the atmosphere is created so well. Hitchcock once said it was the most terrifying movie he's ever made, he was correct. The special effects of the birds are something quite remarkable for its time, unbelievably believable. The Birds takes it time to develop the storyline, but I never lost interest. The script fully realizes and understands its characters, just as good, if not better than any other Hitchcock picture. Tippi Hedren is phenomenal as the lead in the film. My favorite Hitchcock lady. She's not the typical heroine, she has rough, unpolished edges to her, but she makes the movie all the more engaging. I loved every second of The Birds, though the one compliant I have is that it feels a manipulative many times using children as the targets of the birds. I thought Hedren's scenes were better. It doesn't detract much from a excellent horror movie. Rating: 10/10 Grade: A+

    This was the first Hitchcock movie I saw, and up until the last 15 minutes of it I thought it was a good movie. When you see it in the the 21st Century you have to think though out the movie that it was made in the '60s and that's why not everything is quite the way one would have wanted it.. The acting was mostly good and most part of the scenes had great camera angles and light etcetera. The only bad thing about the movie was, like stated above, the last 15 minutes of the film. Why did she go in to the room, instead of just peeking in? Why did she not put up more of a fight with the birds? Why did the birds to this? And why so many different birds? And what happened after they drove off? I H.A.T.E. having questions instead of answers at the end of a movie.
