  During the medieval times, Martin Guerre returns to his hometown in the middle of France, after being away in the war since he was a child.

    Martin Guerre was a young man who, in 1548, disappeared from the southern French village of Artigat after being accused of stealing grain from his father. Eight years later, a man arrived in Artigat claiming to be Martin. He was accepted as such by Guerre's wife Bertrande and family, and lived with Bertrande as her husband for three years, although some villagers entertained doubts about his identity. Rumours, encouraged by Guerre's uncle Pierre who was involved in a property dispute with his supposed nephew, began to spread that this "Martin" was in fact an impostor. He was arrested and placed on trial, but his intimate knowledge of Guerre's past life and the support he still enjoyed from many villagers seemed likely to secure his acquittal. During the trial, however, there was a dramatic development; another man turned up claiming to be Martin Guerre. It was quickly established that the newcomer was indeed the true Martin and that the impostor was in reality a man from a neighbouring village named Arnaud du Tilh. Du Tilh was convicted and subsequently hanged, adultery and fraud being capital offences in the France of this period. A number of writers and film-makers have taken inspiration from these events, Whereas the later American film "Sommersby" tells a fictitious tale loosely based upon the story of Martin Guerre, transferring the action to nineteenth-century Virginia, Daniel Vigne's film is a reasonably accurate version of the historical events, aiming at a reconstruction of 16th century French peasant life. The main role, that of du Tilh, is taken by G&eacute;rard Depardieu, possibly France's finest modern screen actor. His attempts to conquer Hollywood have not been very successful, but I have never seen him give a poor performance in his native language, and this is a fine one, playing his character as a plausible and at times almost likable rogue. He is particularly good in the electrifying trial scene. Whatever else du Tilh may have been, he was clearly a consummate actor, and Depardieu's impassioned speeches reflect his character's knowledge that he needs to give the performance of his life, as that life now depends upon his acting skills. Just as it seems that du Tilh has succeeded in his imposture, Vigne interrupts the proceedings with a brilliant coup de cinema; the sight of a man with a wooden leg entering the courtroom. Or rather the sight of the wooden leg itself- the angle from which the scene is shot means that we see this before we see the man's face. (We have heard it suggested that the newcomer cannot be Martin Guerre because the real Martin, after leaving the village, joined the army and lost a leg in battle). Other acting fine contributions come from Roger Planchon as Jean de Coras, the humane and sceptical lawyer in charge of the investigation, and Nathalie Baye as Bertrande, a young woman placed in a difficult situation by the return of her supposed "husband". It is implied that Bertrande, despite her doubts, welcomed du Tilh into her bed because he was both a better lover and a more considerate husband than the departed Martin, who seems to have been deficient in both departments. I would, perhaps, have welcomed a greater exploration of why du Tilh might have tried to claim another man's identity, although Vigne possibly wanted to create a sense of mystery by keeping alive as long as possible the thought that Depardieu's character might actually be the real Martin. Vigne makes use of few bright colours other than the green of the vegetation and the red of the judges' robes during the trial; in the days before chemical dyestuffs bright colours did not play a large part in the lives of the peasantry. Visually, however, the film is suffused with a warmth of tone reminiscent of an Old master painting; I was particularly put in mind of the works of Breughel and Georges de la Tour celebrating peasant life. It is sometime said that the British are obsessed with the glories of their past, and that in the cinema this is reflected by the large number of films made on a historical theme. French film-makers, however, seem equally obsessed with history, and this was particularly true in the eighties and nineties. "Le Retour de Martin Guerre" is one of a number of fine French films on a historical theme to date from this period. (Others include "Jean de Florette", "Cyrano de Bergerac" and "Le Colonel Chabert", all of which also starred Depardieu). It is well-filmed and well-acted and takes an intelligent and humane look at the strange historical events which inspired it. 8/10

    Set in early renaissance Arriege, this movie is truly as masterpiece. Don't be put off by subtitles, just enjoy. Depardieu is superb, one of his best performances...Truly amazing! The story: Bertrande de Rolls's husband, Martin Guerre disappeared sometime ago. She remained faithful, until Arnaud du Tilh, appears and pretends to be the returning Martin Guerre. If, like me, you like both, movies and history, you must watch that masterpiece. The costumes, the settings, the decors, peasant life... all made to recreate a corner of french renaissance countryside. The story is based on facts, on real events. It's a true story, slightly changed and without the catholic-protestant antagonism. What a brilliant movie!!! Like to know more? Read Natalie Zemon Davis'"The return of Martin Guerre"

    Daniel Vigne described his film as a modern story that took place in 16th century.Le Retour de Martin Guerre is a wonderful historic romance that pertinently comments on an individual's role in society.The film is a beautiful illustration of 16th century pastoral life. Pancette had the nerve to assume Martin's identity as Bertrande constantly assisted him in deceit.His greed was responsible for his ruin as he claimed wealth which never belonged to him.A vast majority of viewers will not be in a position to form an opinion about Bertrande as she did not wish to spend her life with an impotent village resident.The entire storyline hinges heavily on Gerard Depardieu's captivating performance.His imposing aura makes us readily accept him as the real Martin Guerre even though,in reality,he is Martin's lookalike Pancette.Le Retour de Martin Guerre will fascinate not only the admirers of suspense genre but also those spectators who are attracted to drama.Daniel Vigne has effectively crafted a thought-provoking oeuvre which competently wrestles with major issues like identity and deception.

    This story is supposedly based on a true story, though the story is so fantastic it's hard to imagine that it actually occurred. The story, in brief, is that a man named Martin Guerre went off to war and was not seen for nearly a decade. When he returned, he seemed to be a nicer person--and in particular, a more attentive and less impotent husband. No one really questioned any of this until a disagreement arose between Martin and his uncle. At that point, the possibility that this was NOT Martin arose and much of the movie consists of the court trials attempting to get at the truth. Exactly what occurs I'll leave to the viewer so as not to spoil it. The acting is wonderful--particularly Gerard Depardieu. The costumes are also very good and fit the era well. And, the movie is a lot more interesting that the American remake (Sommersby) in every way. The story is awfully complex and interesting as well, but it does, at times, drag a bit--so some with shorter attention-spans and little interest in period dramas would certainly be put off by this. I loved it, but given that I am a history teacher, this isn't so surprising. An interesting tiny and unimportant mistake that my wife noticed was that the inside of the church in the film shows very very faded painting on the walls. However, when the film was to have occurred, they probably would have really been fresher--and a lot brighter. I never noticed this but she was right.

    An intriguing premise, fitting music, and a solid performance by Nathalie Baye make this okay viewing overall, but it is terribly overlong, since the premise just does not have enough in it to last for a two-hour length. The situations and various issues that arise are interesting at first, but it all becomes a bit repetitive, drawn out and monotonous as the film progresses. This was a breakthrough piece for G&eacute;rard Depardieu, who does quite a good job, and the film was Academy Award nominated for its apt costumes too. It is quite competently made, and certainly quite watchable, despite somewhat awkward narration and thrills and excitement that are only intermittent. I cannot help but feel however that as a short film the material would have worked better. Either way, it is still worth a look.

    There is, of course, as someone once said, nothing new under the sun and the cynic in me wonders if Janet Lewis, who wrote (in 1982) the novel on which this film is based, was familiar with a British film directed in 1946 by Basil Dearden entitled 'The Captive Heart'. In that film a Czech soldier, Karel Hasek (Micheael Redgrave) assumes the identity of a dead British soldier, Geoffrey Mitchell, in order to survive and when he is sent to a P.O.W. camp he is obliged to correspond with the dead man's wife, Celia (Rachel Kempson) in order to maintain the pretence and gradually via this correspondence they fall in love but when, at the end of the war, Hasek meets Mitchell there is no question of his pretending to be her dead husband. Daniel Vigne has taken the novel by Lewis and adapted it for the screen. By setting it a few centuries in the past both writer and director distance it from The Captive Heart and do so further by depicting the real Martin Guerre in situ with wife Bertande (Nathalie Baye) then, after establishing his indifference to Bertrande he is allowed to abandon her. Years pass and Martin returns in the shape of Gerard Depardieu who is able to assuage doubts about his identity via his wide knowledge of both Bertande and the neighbors. There's not a great deal of suspense, it's fairly obvious that Depardieu is NOT the Martin Guerre who left the village but Vigne is more concerned with illustrating that Good can come out of Bad; living with Depardieu Baye is much more happy than when living with the real Martin and the faux Martin also proves a much better neighbor so it's just a question of waiting for the bubble to burst and wonder if hope will triumph over knowledge (no such luck) and the lovers will be allowed to live happily ever after. Both Depardieu and Baye turn in first class jobs and the period setting is well photographed. If not exactly a 'must-see' it is well worth seeing.

    Among foreign films I've watched, the "return of Martin Guerre" is definitely a must see. It truly stays true to history, as much as possible. I found it interesting that the film came into being only because Coras had written about this otherwise obscure occurrence. Furthermore the way the characters were portrayed in such a true to form manner that made this film even more worth watching. I found the entire trial scene as particularly interesting. Also the scenes from the farm, give true insight to what 1500's Europe may have been like. I also give high marks to the social commentary, showing how far someone can go for financial gain, and how something that started solely as for personal gain continues to go on because those involved appear to be satisfied with the arrangement. this is very insightful as to how it related to human emotion. i strongly recommend this film to all, especially to those like myself that like true local historic themes.

    A classic G&eacute;rard Depardieu film. Any Depardieu fan will love it. In French, It follows a newly married couple's life through their difficulties. I feel that that acting is solid and their marital problems are somewhat humorous if not relatable to today. It explores marital problems in a realistic and open way. Though there is some brief nudity, it follows the story. It is truly a story about love, and what you will do for it. It's a story that will touch your heart.

    OK. This is not a remake of "carrefour", as many may think. This is the actual story, on which carrefour was based, from 16th century France, it just happens to have been transferred to film after the other adaptation. Go read the book if you're at all interested, it's by Janet Lewis and is called "The Wife of Martin Guerre". The story is based on court documents among other things, and the character names in this film are those of the actual people. Don't get confused- carrefour may have been made before this film, but this is the closer adaptation and, thus, should not be labeled a remake.

    After about thirteen or fourteen years I finally was able to see this film again, this time in French with subtitles, not dubbed into German. There was nothing wrong with the German version, the film certainly didn't fail to impress me so much, that I declared this film to be the best G&eacute;rard Depardieu has ever done. I think I still have the same opinion, although meanwhile it ties with Les Mis&eacute;rables. Now today I watched it again. I couldn't remember anything really, just parts of scenes and what happened at the end, of course. But then everything came back. The music suddenly seemed familiar, the village, the faces. I still was surprised to see Tcheky Karyo's name in the credits at the end, because I missed him completely, while I recognized Dominique Pinon at once, much younger of course. Again I stood in awe of the costumes and the village scenery. Everything was so convincing and realistic. As if someone had done a time travel and brought back a video. After The Name of the Rose this is the best period film till now. In the art department. But also certainly in acting, writing and directing. G&eacute;rard Depardieu and Nathalie Baye deliver performances which are outstanding. Every acting student should watch them, they are masters of their profession. They show emotions which are almost palpable, you feel with them, certainly towards the end, but also during the rest of the time. The script offered them "only" great parts and they created lives out of the printed words. Every gesture, every movement, every look fits and connects the viewer with the story. As if you're in the story, not watching it. There is no doubt whatsoever that this story is real. Even if history should have been a bit different (which I don't know), the story in the film feels real. And I just want to add that everyone who calls M. Depardieu ugly or anything like it, is not only extremely rude but obviously not receptive to any kind of charisma and aura. With actors (as with people in general, right?) looks are not important. Whoever thinks that, should switch from watching films to watching models. There he can get empty beauty. My recommendation is: watch this film. You can hardly spend an evening in a better way. 10 out of 10.

Also the scenes from the farm, give true insight to what 1500's Europe may have been like. I also give high marks to the social commentary, showing how far someone can go for financial gain, and how something that started solely as for personal gain continues to go on because those involved appear to be satisfied with the arrangement. this is very insightful as to how it related to human emotion. i strongly recommend this film to all, especially to those like myself that like true local historic themes.

    A classic G&eacute;rard Depardieu film. Any Depardieu fan will love it. In French, It follows a newly married couple's life through their difficulties. I feel that that acting is solid and their marital problems are somewhat humorous if not relatable to today. It explores marital problems in a realistic and open way. Though there is some brief nudity, it follows the story. It is truly a story about love, and what you will do for it. It's a story that will touch your heart.

    OK. This is not a remake of "carrefour", as many may think. This is the actual story, on which carrefour was based, from 16th century France, it just happens to have been transferred to film after the other adaptation. Go read the book if you're at all interested, it's by Janet Lewis and is called "The Wife of Martin Guerre". The story is based on court documents among other things, and the character names in this film are those of the actual people. Don't get confused- carrefour may have been made before this film, but this is the closer adaptation and, thus, should not be labeled a remake.

    After about thirteen or fourteen years I finally was able to see this film again, this time in French with subtitles, not dubbed into German. There was nothing wrong with the German version, the film certainly didn't fail to impress me so much, that I declared this film to be the best G&eacute;rard Depardieu has ever done. I think I still have the same opinion, although meanwhile it ties with Les Mis&eacute;rables. Now today I watched it again. I couldn't remember anything really, just parts of scenes and what happened at the end, of course. But then everything came back. The music suddenly seemed familiar, the village, the faces. I still was surprised to see Tcheky Karyo's name in the credits at the end, because I missed him completely, while I recognized Dominique Pinon at once, much younger of course. Again I stood in awe of the costumes and the village scenery. Everything was so convincing and realistic. As if someone had done a time travel and brought back a video. After The Name of the Rose this is the best period film till now. In the art department. But also certainly in acting, writing and directing. G&eacute;rard Depardieu and Nathalie Baye deliver performances which are outstanding. Every acting student should watch them, they are masters of their profession. They show emotions which are almost palpable, you feel with them, certainly towards the end, but also during the rest of the time. The script offered them "only" great parts and they created lives out of the printed words. Every gesture, every movement, every look fits and connects the viewer with the story. As if you're in the story, not watching it. There is no doubt whatsoever that this story is real. Even if history should have been a bit different (which I don't know), the story in the film feels real. And I just want to add that everyone who calls M. Depardieu ugly or anything like it, is not only extremely rude but obviously not receptive to any kind of charisma and aura. With actors (as with people in general, right?) looks are not important. Whoever thinks that, should switch from watching films to watching models. There he can get empty beauty. My recommendation is: watch this film. You can hardly spend an evening in a better way. 10 out of 10.

    Martin Guerre was a young man who, in 1548, disappeared from the southern French village of Artigat after being accused of stealing grain from his father. Eight years later, a man arrived in Artigat claiming to be Martin. He was accepted as such by Guerre's wife Bertrande and family, and lived with Bertrande as her husband for three years, although some villagers entertained doubts about his identity. Rumours, encouraged by Guerre's uncle Pierre who was involved in a property dispute with his supposed nephew, began to spread that this "Martin" was in fact an impostor. He was arrested and placed on trial, but his intimate knowledge of Guerre's past life and the support he still enjoyed from many villagers seemed likely to secure his acquittal. During the trial, however, there was a dramatic development; another man turned up claiming to be Martin Guerre. It was quickly established that the newcomer was indeed the true Martin and that the impostor was in reality a man from a neighbouring village named Arnaud du Tilh. Du Tilh was convicted and subsequently hanged, adultery and fraud being capital offences in the France of this period. A number of writers and film-makers have taken inspiration from these events, Whereas the later American film "Sommersby" tells a fictitious tale loosely based upon the story of Martin Guerre, transferring the action to nineteenth-century Virginia, Daniel Vigne's film is a reasonably accurate version of the historical events, aiming at a reconstruction of 16th century French peasant life. The main role, that of du Tilh, is taken by G&eacute;rard Depardieu, possibly France's finest modern screen actor. His attempts to conquer Hollywood have not been very successful, but I have never seen him give a poor performance in his native language, and this is a fine one, playing his character as a plausible and at times almost likable rogue. He is particularly good in the electrifying trial scene. Whatever else du Tilh may have been, he was clearly a consummate actor, and Depardieu's impassioned speeches reflect his character's knowledge that he needs to give the performance of his life, as that life now depends upon his acting skills. Just as it seems that du Tilh has succeeded in his imposture, Vigne interrupts the proceedings with a brilliant coup de cinema; the sight of a man with a wooden leg entering the courtroom. Or rather the sight of the wooden leg itself- the angle from which the scene is shot means that we see this before we see the man's face. (We have heard it suggested that the newcomer cannot be Martin Guerre because the real Martin, after leaving the village, joined the army and lost a leg in battle). Other acting fine contributions come from Roger Planchon as Jean de Coras, the humane and sceptical lawyer in charge of the investigation, and Nathalie Baye as Bertrande, a young woman placed in a difficult situation by the return of her supposed "husband". It is implied that Bertrande, despite her doubts, welcomed du Tilh into her bed because he was both a better lover and a more considerate husband than the departed Martin, who seems to have been deficient in both departments. I would, perhaps, have welcomed a greater exploration of why du Tilh might have tried to claim another man's identity, although Vigne possibly wanted to create a sense of mystery by keeping alive as long as possible the thought that Depardieu's character might actually be the real Martin. Vigne makes use of few bright colours other than the green of the vegetation and the red of the judges' robes during the trial; in the days before chemical dyestuffs bright colours did not play a large part in the lives of the peasantry. Visually, however, the film is suffused with a warmth of tone reminiscent of an Old master painting; I was particularly put in mind of the works of Breughel and Georges de la Tour celebrating peasant life. It is sometime said that the British are obsessed with the glories of their past, and that in the cinema this is reflected by the large number of films made on a historical theme. French film-makers, however, seem equally obsessed with history, and this was particularly true in the eighties and nineties. "Le Retour de Martin Guerre" is one of a number of fine French films on a historical theme to date from this period. (Others include "Jean de Florette", "Cyrano de Bergerac" and "Le Colonel Chabert", all of which also starred Depardieu). It is well-filmed and well-acted and takes an intelligent and humane look at the strange historical events which inspired it. 8/10

    Set in early renaissance Arriege, this movie is truly as masterpiece. Don't be put off by subtitles, just enjoy. Depardieu is superb, one of his best performances...Truly amazing! The story: Bertrande de Rolls's husband, Martin Guerre disappeared sometime ago. She remained faithful, until Arnaud du Tilh, appears and pretends to be the returning Martin Guerre. If, like me, you like both, movies and history, you must watch that masterpiece. The costumes, the settings, the decors, peasant life... all made to recreate a corner of french renaissance countryside. The story is based on facts, on real events. It's a true story, slightly changed and without the catholic-protestant antagonism. What a brilliant movie!!! Like to know more? Read Natalie Zemon Davis'"The return of Martin Guerre"

    Daniel Vigne described his film as a modern story that took place in 16th century.Le Retour de Martin Guerre is a wonderful historic romance that pertinently comments on an individual's role in society.The film is a beautiful illustration of 16th century pastoral life. Pancette had the nerve to assume Martin's identity as Bertrande constantly assisted him in deceit.His greed was responsible for his ruin as he claimed wealth which never belonged to him.A vast majority of viewers will not be in a position to form an opinion about Bertrande as she did not wish to spend her life with an impotent village resident.The entire storyline hinges heavily on Gerard Depardieu's captivating performance.His imposing aura makes us readily accept him as the real Martin Guerre even though,in reality,he is Martin's lookalike Pancette.Le Retour de Martin Guerre will fascinate not only the admirers of suspense genre but also those spectators who are attracted to drama.Daniel Vigne has effectively crafted a thought-provoking oeuvre which competently wrestles with major issues like identity and deception.

    This story is supposedly based on a true story, though the story is so fantastic it's hard to imagine that it actually occurred. The story, in brief, is that a man named Martin Guerre went off to war and was not seen for nearly a decade. When he returned, he seemed to be a nicer person--and in particular, a more attentive and less impotent husband. No one really questioned any of this until a disagreement arose between Martin and his uncle. At that point, the possibility that this was NOT Martin arose and much of the movie consists of the court trials attempting to get at the truth. Exactly what occurs I'll leave to the viewer so as not to spoil it. The acting is wonderful--particularly Gerard Depardieu. The costumes are also very good and fit the era well. And, the movie is a lot more interesting that the American remake (Sommersby) in every way. The story is awfully complex and interesting as well, but it does, at times, drag a bit--so some with shorter attention-spans and little interest in period dramas would certainly be put off by this. I loved it, but given that I am a history teacher, this isn't so surprising. An interesting tiny and unimportant mistake that my wife noticed was that the inside of the church in the film shows very very faded painting on the walls. However, when the film was to have occurred, they probably would have really been fresher--and a lot brighter. I never noticed this but she was right.

    An intriguing premise, fitting music, and a solid performance by Nathalie Baye make this okay viewing overall, but it is terribly overlong, since the premise just does not have enough in it to last for a two-hour length. The situations and various issues that arise are interesting at first, but it all becomes a bit repetitive, drawn out and monotonous as the film progresses. This was a breakthrough piece for G&eacute;rard Depardieu, who does quite a good job, and the film was Academy Award nominated for its apt costumes too. It is quite competently made, and certainly quite watchable, despite somewhat awkward narration and thrills and excitement that are only intermittent. I cannot help but feel however that as a short film the material would have worked better. Either way, it is still worth a look.

    There is, of course, as someone once said, nothing new under the sun and the cynic in me wonders if Janet Lewis, who wrote (in 1982) the novel on which this film is based, was familiar with a British film directed in 1946 by Basil Dearden entitled 'The Captive Heart'. In that film a Czech soldier, Karel Hasek (Micheael Redgrave) assumes the identity of a dead British soldier, Geoffrey Mitchell, in order to survive and when he is sent to a P.O.W. camp he is obliged to correspond with the dead man's wife, Celia (Rachel Kempson) in order to maintain the pretence and gradually via this correspondence they fall in love but when, at the end of the war, Hasek meets Mitchell there is no question of his pretending to be her dead husband. Daniel Vigne has taken the novel by Lewis and adapted it for the screen. By setting it a few centuries in the past both writer and director distance it from The Captive Heart and do so further by depicting the real Martin Guerre in situ with wife Bertande (Nathalie Baye) then, after establishing his indifference to Bertrande he is allowed to abandon her. Years pass and Martin returns in the shape of Gerard Depardieu who is able to assuage doubts about his identity via his wide knowledge of both Bertande and the neighbors. There's not a great deal of suspense, it's fairly obvious that Depardieu is NOT the Martin Guerre who left the village but Vigne is more concerned with illustrating that Good can come out of Bad; living with Depardieu Baye is much more happy than when living with the real Martin and the faux Martin also proves a much better neighbor so it's just a question of waiting for the bubble to burst and wonder if hope will triumph over knowledge (no such luck) and the lovers will be allowed to live happily ever after. Both Depardieu and Baye turn in first class jobs and the period setting is well photographed. If not exactly a 'must-see' it is well worth seeing.

    Among foreign films I've watched, the "return of Martin Guerre" is definitely a must see. It truly stays true to history, as much as possible. I found it interesting that the film came into being only because Coras had written about this otherwise obscure occurrence. Furthermore the way the characters were portrayed in such a true to form manner that made this film even more worth watching. I found the entire trial scene as particularly interesting. Also the scenes from the farm, give true insight to what 1500's Europe may have been like. I also give high marks to the social commentary, showing how far someone can go for financial gain, and how something that started solely as for personal gain continues to go on because those involved appear to be satisfied with the arrangement. this is very insightful as to how it related to human emotion. i strongly recommend this film to all, especially to those like myself that like true local historic themes.
