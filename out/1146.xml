 <sinopse>
  Three young men go on an end of the summer trip to Hollywood, CA. Their quest: to fulfill the fantasy of meeting Marilyn Monroe.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Like many adolescent boys, Roy Darpinian had the hots for movie divas, and one in particular was his wet dream as half of America's in the 1950s: Marilyn Monroe. The difference is, one summer holiday he actually decided to enlist his spineless buddies, Scott Foreman and Ned Bleuer, to actually drive all the way to Hollywood and make as many desperate attempts as it takes to meet her or get arrested trying, and no setback or embarrassment (even publicly bare-ass) can stop or distract him. Against all odds, he finally even got a chance to help her...

    Despite this film getting its title from Neil Sedaka's hit song from the early Sixties, Calendar Girl which does take place at that time is about three teen males with raging hormones wanting to meet that ultimate of Calendar Girls, Marilyn Monroe. If you remember Marilyn did the ultimate calendar photos back before these kids reached puberty, but they do discover here and she kind of brings the male out in all three of them. Anyway our three teens are Jason Priestley, Jerry O'Connell, and Gabriel Olds who decide to take a trip to Hollywood to meet the girl of their wet dreams. Interesting they chose Marilyn, back then which was when I was that age, your typical heterosexual budding teen male fantasized more about Annette Funnicello than Marilyn Monroe. But these kids certainly had mature tastes. Olds narrates the film which is seen through his character eyes and frankly when you come right down to it, it's about stalking. Of course the term hadn't been invented yet. But now a film star of the magnitude of Marilyn Monroe would not be so accommodating. We've heard real stories about people like Brad Pitt and David Letterman dealing with stalking fans. Still it's a harmless teenage comedy and will no doubt please the fans of the leads.

    I must wonder to tell you the truth because when it comes to a night out with the great (Marilyn Monroe), and a chance to kiss her too ..HHHHOOO this is wild man..Very wild.. So when they made it as something which's less enjoyable than the ordinary life.. I've got to veto and in a hard way too ! But come to think of it, as the movie's point of view is so interesting : the friendship with humans lives longer than the other with the stars, as reality is more honest and amusing than movies.. Hmmm... Try to imagine that !. The boy here discovered that the cinematic dream, even if it was as incredibly fantastic as (Marilyn) herself, is just a dream. So all the rest of our silly, foolish, and risky actual life is more fantastic because we actually lived it. Even if it contained some nightmares already ! Hence the jam in the phone booth with a girl you want becomes eventually more important than a lively fantasy you may live Â–like the movie fulfills indeed - with your own calendar girl. This movie made too many regards which are truly full of love and longing to a lot of things : the adolescence's folly, the friendship's coolest memories, the pure fondness of a movie star, the fiery sexy yet innocent days of the late 1950s and the early 1960s, the good old Hollywood, and lastly the utmost sex icon ..The shiniest star yet.. (Marilyn Monroe). She was portrayed here as sad lonely woman, missing what these young men already have : the friendship, who dies with the beauty of that era and the end of those guys' minority too; as if this time was the adolescence's climax of America itself before Vietnam, the series of assassinations, the hippie revelation.. etc. I loved the whole deal : the nice comedy, the good characterization, the performance from all the young bunch, the bright cinematography, and the atmosphere which was in low budget but so solid, look at the details to know how it's a sincere adorer movie for what it speaks about (the clever wicked opening credits, the bits of Marilyn's movies or photos, the soundtrack's songs.. etc). It got a "real" sentimental script and directing. Although the face of (St&eacute;phanie Anderson) as (Marilyn) didn't appear on screen like a high too glaring to watch phantasm, but truly she delivered by her voice and body a fine performance. Still the part of the kiss is such a magical cinematic moment and one of the most immortal kisses I've ever seen as well, not only because its achievement of what any fan of (Marilyn) dreamed of (getting a special kiss from her) but also because it was one unforgettable hot kiss in so colorfully sensual close up. In brief it was as madly sexy as any of Marilyn's kisses yet more emotional and a bit lamentably moving. It's one comic so passionate movie which has no shame in presenting this obligatory phase of life when you've got to know your dream so consequently your fact !, and what a lessen the movie gives softly through its gentle manifesto : viva the 1950s, (Marilyn), the boyhood, the fictional world, and the most of all : viva the genius experiment of factual LIFE.

    Jason Priestley as box office draw? Get real! If his "career" hadn't already been dead, this "effort" definitely would have killed it. The story here is that of three childhood buddies and their infatuation with Marilyn Monroe, told in flash backs. Nice 1950s & 60s "Americana", complete with golden oldie tunes, fashions, movie clips, cars and other period gimmicks. Other than the "time travel" perks, there's not much to see. A perpetually cigarette-smoking, baby-faced Priestly becomes annoying. The "tough guy" image of his character reminds us of the equally unbelievable Prince in "Purple Rain". This is no "Stand By Me", so be prepared for a disappointment.

    I have seen this as it has been on HBO non stop lately. I think the writing and acting is good. It seems innocent enough. However, it seems a little strange as well. It is about three boys who worship Marilyn Monroe and even keep pictures of her in the "Holy Bible." They take a road trip to go meet Marilyn and continue to bother her at home until one gets a date with her. Seems like they had a little too much time on their hands. I have advice for the three boys: grab a dictionary and look up the word "pathetic." I give it a 6 out of 10. Could have done without the stalking stuff as that is what made it strange to me. Otherwise, it was pretty good.

    A pleasant and amusing story about three senior high school students (although all look way older than that) who are infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. (so am I am and who isn't or wasn't?) It is a nice movie about the importance of the value of good friends. There are various sub plots here. Jason Priestley's character learns to reconnect with his estranged father and all three young men learn and grow by the end of the movie. It is funny and amusing and really rather sweet. I enjoyed it and I recommend it. Jason Priestly does a good job, but he is so much shorter, he is 5'6 or 5'7, than the other two boys who are 6 ft, and he is always looking so short--they even hold him up to see an event in the movie. Anyway, it is an enjoyable movie and one especially suited to teenagers, and, of course, all us Marilyn Monroe fans. There are various clips from Marilyn's movies. Lest we forget.

    A routine but pleasant comedy about three best friends (Jason Priestley, Gabriel Olds, Jerry O'Connell) who are obsessed with Marilyn Monroe. They pool their resources to plan a road trip to meet their idol. Film is set in 1962 and uses good attention to period detail and music.

    Almost nobody's seen this movie, but it's secretly a great film. Funny all the way through. One of Jason Priestly's early films and he's great as in everything he does. (No not all of his films are good, but he's good in all of them). It's a movie you don't think you'll want to watch and 15 minutes in, you want to watch the whole thing. Enjoyable, very quotable, and about what every man dreams of-meeting Marilyn Monroe.

    Three friends grow up worshipping Marilyn Monroe. When they are in their late teens they decide to drive out to Hollywood to meet her. Roy, Ned and Scott head off a week before Roy is due to join the army. They stay with Roy's uncle Harvey and begin their quest, however Roy has borrowed mobster money and his fathers car for the trip and before long the Gallo brothers come looking for their cash. As I sat to watch this, it did cross my mind that I didn't really need to watch another coming of age movie set in the 50's and 60's. However I thought the premise was interesting enough to justify the time. However the film fails to use the idea of the quest to meet Monroe to raise anything more than a few laughs. We also have to deal with the usual subplots of teenage angst, girls, sex, anger at father etc, these take even more of the comedy away leaving a so-so comedy with bits of drama forced in. The characters are standard Â– Priestly plays the cocky one, Olds plays the thoughtful one and O'Connell plays the shy, cowardly one. The only interest is provided by the support cast - Pantoliano is good as Roy's uncle with a typically Hollywood obsession with looks and Tobolowsky and Fuller provide the only quirky characters as the Gallo's. The idea of Monroe as the holy grail would have worked better if the film didn't try to have her as a shadow but also use her Â– her memory is badly used here. Overall this has some funny scenes but not enough to justify the film. The coming of age drama doesn't really work and I think we've all got the `seize the day' message by now. Average.

    This movie, although of its year of made, is quite close of any teenager-light-stupid-vacation movie made in the 50's. That was the idea? I guess so. Three youngsters deeply in love with Marilyn Monroe travel to Hollywood to meet her. That's all. Jason Priestley is the leader of them (he is the protagonist, by the way), playing the role of the typical unbearable & arrogant American High school popular kid, who thinks that can deal with any chick round there. Jerry O'Connel plays again as the poor little fool dominated by his friends (do you remember "Stand by me"?) & the other guy, Gabriel Olds (sorry but, who is he? Never heard of him) is the peacemaker of the group. It's a very light comedy, & that's all. Nothing too hard to understand.
